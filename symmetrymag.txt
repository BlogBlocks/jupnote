A20: Here is an example: the discovery of neutrino oscillations told us that neutrinos‚Ä¶ (1/2) #AskSymmetry
Q20: @pnkpot How could neutrino flavor-mixing findings affect how we explore our universe? #asksymmetry
A19: CP symmetry might be violated even without a fourth neutrino flavor! This is what the @DUNEscience experiment is after. #AskSymmetry
"Q19: @gohanvsrohan If all of sudden we discover fourth neutrino flavor, will CP symmetry still be conserved? #AskSymmetry"
@Totomilo9 Thanks for participating!
"A18: ... the higher their energy is. So who knows, maybe if we wait longer we‚Äôll see even more energetic ones? (3/3) #AskSymmetry"

"I'm still typing answers to a few last questions, but heading out soon! This has been awesome! #AskSymmetry"
"A16: I would love to hold one in my hand, but alas, no. #AskSymmetry"
Q16: @KSUSHANTHREDDY9 Is it possible for a neutrino to be at rest or made to come to rest?#AskSymmetry
.@dumbeast  This tells us that not all three neutrino flavors can have a mass of 0. #AskSymmetry
".@dumbeast Yes, in order to oscillate the 3 neutrino flavors must have different masses. #AskSymmetry"
A15: Or how heavy they are on an absolute mass scale. Or where they are coming from in the universe. (6/6) #AskSymmetry
A15: In other experiments you might try to assess if neutrinos are their own antiparticles. (5/6) #AskSymmetry
"A15: such as mixing angles and mass differences, and to study if neutrinos behave the same way as antineutrinos. (4/6) #AskSymmetry"
"A15: In an oscillation experiment, you want to use this information to measure neutrino properties (3/6) #AskSymmetry"
"A15: Typically, we try to estimate the neutrinos energy, flavor, and arrival direction with our detectors. (2/6) #AskSymmetry"
"A15: This depends on many aspects, like what type of detector you have &amp; what energy range of neutrinos we're looking at. (1/6) #AskSymmetry"
Q15: @bordeauxcarol How much data can be obtained from a detection? What properties can be measured? #AskSymmetry
"A14: Since they pass through you without interacting, they don‚Äôt leave any trace or sign. They are very tiny and very light. #AskSymmetry"
Q14: @Dav_Coulter Why don't we feel neutrinos passing through us?  #AskSymmetry
"A13: But it would have to be a lot heavier - much more than 100,000 times! (3/3) #AskSymmetry"
"A13: If we made the neutrino a lot heavier than it is, it might eventually interact with you via the gravitational force. (2/3) #AskSymmetry"

A12:  The question of how neutrinos get mass and if/how this involves the Higgs field is still not solved. #AskSymmetry
"Q12: @nicodenooijer Does the higgs field interact with neutrinos? If no, why? #AskSymmetry"
A11: They could be astrophysical objects such as Active Galactic Nuclei or Gamma Ray Bursts. (3/3) #AskSymmetry

Q10: @gohanvsrohan what are the current plausible models for explaining neutrino's masses? #AskSymmetry
"A9: indicating they were faster than light, but this was a false claim and the result was taken back and corrected. (2/2) #AskSymmetry"
"A9: No, they don‚Äôt! There was a previous measurement from the OPERA detector a few years ago... (1/2) #AskSymmetry"
Q9: @Totomilo9 Do neutrinos actually move faster than light? #AskSymmetry
"A8: So yes, the three flavors are different particles. (4/4) #AskSymmetry"
A8: There are three different neutrino flavor eigenstates which we can observe and distinguish in experiments. (3/4) #AskSymmetry
A8: Each neutrino flavor eigenstate is a mixture of different neutrino mass eigenstates. (2/4) #AskSymmetry
A8: We observe neutrino oscillations through a change of the neutrino flavor. (1/4) #AskSymmetry
Q8: @RBZ_TheOne Does neutrino mass change due to oscillations at the quantum level or are they different particles? #AskSymmetry
@symmetrymag A7: It will be very rare and no outgoing particle would be created that we could detect. (2/2) #AskSymmetry
A7: You can imagine two neutrinos would collide and bounce off each other. (1/2) #AskSymmetry
"Q7: @KSUSHANTHREDDY9 Is a collision between two neutrinos possible? If yes, can we detect that? #AskSymmetry"
"A6: their interactions with matter are rare and they mostly just pass through us, our detectors, and the Earth itself. (2/2) #AskSymmetry"
"A6: Neutrinos only interact via the weak force, which, as its name says, is very weak. This means... (1/2) #AskSymmetry"
Q6: @Totomilo9 Why are neutrinos so hard to catch and observe? #AskSymmetry
"A5: don‚Äôt interact via the strong force, so there‚Äôs no color charge exchange involved in neutrino-nucleon interactions. (2/2) #AskSymmetry"
"A5: Sounds like you are asking about ‚Äúcolor‚Äù in the sense of color charge, like in quarks. In that respect, neutrinos... (1/2) #AskSymmetry"
"Q5: @KevinFaircloth1: When Neutrinos engage with Nucleic material in the Earth's atmosphere, is a predominant color exposed? #AskSymmetry"
RT @30de2e4d6c4f416: @symmetrymag just helping - neutrinos are extremely energetic and produced in extremely large numbers. 1/
A4: Neutrinos don‚Äôt interact via the electromagnetic force and therefore don‚Äôt emit or absorb photons. #AskSymmetry
Q4: @KSUSHANTHREDDY9: Do neutrinos absorb light? #AskSymmetry
"A3: The Standard Model predicts neutrinos should be massless, but that‚Äôs not what we observe. (2/2) #asksymmetry"
A3: Neutrinos can only oscillate if they have mass. The current SM doesn‚Äôt explain how the neutrinos get their masses. (1/2) #asksymmetry
Q3: @Keanmon What is it about our current Standard Model of the universe that fails to explain neutrino oscillations? #asksymmetry
A2: but you never know how the basic knowledge we gain today will facilitate technological developments years from now! (3/3) #AskSymmetry

"A17: This is indeed why, in theoretical physics, we usually prefer to have very well-defined, self-consistent theories 3/3 #AskSymmetry"
A17: But it is hard to imagine the consequences of this without a specific theory 2/3 #AskSymmetry
A17: It is possible that time is somewhat discrete at frequency of order the planck energy 1/3 #AskSymmetry
Q17  @AaronSupertramp: What could be the implications in the laws of physics with time being discrete and not continuous? #AskSymmetry
"A16: In this case, things could in principle be different 3/3 #AskSymmetry"
A16: There are theories in which extradimensions are very large &amp; we live in 3dimensional membrane 2/3 #AskSymmetry
A16: I doubt they will be. Because we are interested in moving along our dimensions 1/2 #AskSymmetry
Q16 @RBZ_TheOne: Is dimension (time-space) curling the answer to faster space travel probably affected by spaceship frequency? #AskSymmetry
"Thanks for all the great questions, we have a few more to answer but we're closing the floor to any new ones #AskSymmetry"
"A15: So, the normal big bang was preceded by Inflation, and we don't know what was before that 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
"A15: Our best current explanation of the bang is when inflation ended, a huge amount of energy was released into radiation 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
"Q15 @VineetWeaslly: since you work on the Universe's beginnings,what are some theories which are trying to explain the bang? #AskSymmetry"
"A14: In Theoretical Physics PhD, you get exposed to many of these problems (for ex.,just look at this twitter chat) 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
"A14: The first time one thinks about an abstract problems, it looks very hard. But the second is easier and so on 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
Q14 @AaronSupertramp: which is a good way to develop this capacity of abstraction? #AskSymmetry
"A13: and so, everything that could happen in quantum mechanics will happen (an infinite amount of time) 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
A13: In a sense yes: there is an infinite number of parallel universes 1/2 #AskSymmetry
"Q13 @AlbertoMenc: Could parallel universes be considered as a sequence of single ""Nows"" of the eternalist theory of time? #AskSymmetry"
A12: Even the actual laws of physics can change! Ex: the mass of the W bosons was zero early on 3/3 #AskSymmetry
A12: Ex: The universe is not dominated by #darkenergy but earlier was dominated by #darkmatter &amp; even earlier by radiation 2/3 #AskSymmetry
A12: Compositions can change as the universe expands 1/3 #AskSymmetry
Q12 @KSUSHANTHREDDY9: what are the properties and composition changes in a continuously expanding universe? #AskSymmetry
"Check out this @symmetrymag article from last year about parallel universes https://t.co/yxDrRz4q0V #AskSymmetry"
A11: There is time after universe appears during which interactions are possible among most regions in the two universes 2/2 #AskSymmetry
A11: Causality does not allow interactions between regions of the universes that are too far apart 1/2 #AskSymmetry
"Q11 @RBZ_TheOne: Do we know any interaction between particles in parallel universes, like electron-positron relationship? #AskSymmetry"
"A10: We expect the singularity to be `resolved‚Äô by a more complete theory, such as String Theory 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
"A10: The singularity is present because our theory, General Relativity, is inadequate to describe very high energy density 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
"Q10 @H__Mikaelson: If we consider the whole universe a manifold, big bang is a singularity, how we can explain it? #AskSymmetry"
"A9: It is not so hard. The main difficulty is that one needs to develop capacity of abstraction, but this comes with training #AskSymmetry"
"Q9 @AaronSupertramp: I want to get into a PhD, how hard is to get a PhD in theoretical physics? #AskSymmetry"
"A8: Yes, absolutely. It is just that light cannot go from one to another pocket universe #AskSymmetry"
Q8 @H__Mikaelson: are the parallel universes in same manifold or not? #AskSymmetry
A7: This is still a big mystery 4/4 #AskSymmetry
A7: The community is quite confused on how to deal with quantum mechanics when the spacetime contain horizons 3/4 #AskSymmetry
A7: It is just that the rapidly expanding universe makes things more subtle 2/4 #AskSymmetry
A7: Inflation‚Äôs theory of parallel universes is consistent with quantum mechanics (and so Everettian many worlds) 1/4 #AskSymmetry
Q7 @AlbertoMenc: Can inflation theory's parallel universes &amp; Everettian many worlds coexist in the same theoretical framework? #AskSymmetry
"A6: The spatial location is different. It is a bit like twins: they are identical, but they are not the same object #AskSymmetry"
Q6 @Forum_Borealis: In what way would/could an Electron in universe A differ from an Electron in universe B.? (or any particle) #AskSymmetry
"A5: It is like a raising bread dough, but take the limit of infinitely big 3/3 #AskSymmetry"
A5: it is just light takes longer to go from one point to another 2/3 #AskSymmetry
A5: You can define expansion without needing to have somewhere to expand into 1/3 #AskSymmetry
"Q5 @KSUSHANTHREDDY9: If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? #ASkSymmetry"
"A4: However, often the entanglement in practice is expected to be very small (2/2) #AskSymmetry"
"A4: Parallel universes can be entangled, because every state in quantum mechanics can be entangled with any other 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
Q4 @H__Mikaelson: the parallel universes are entangled or they're totally different? #AskSymmetry
"A3: . They are real. Indeed, the number of space dimensions has experimental consequences 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
"A3: If the additional spatial dimensions are curled up so that they are very small, then they could exist 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
Q3 @RBZ_TheOne Is there a possibility we have more than 1 dimension on Earth &amp; each one corresponds to 1 reality in time-space? #AskSymmetry
"A2: This does not violate Pauli Exclusion P. In fact, for example, their wavefunctions do not overlap 3/3 #AskSymmetry"
"A2: So, the same-looking state can be occupied by two different electrons in two universes 2/3 #AskSymmetry"
A2: The space of states is much larger in a multiverse. There can be multiple copies of the same universe 1/3 #AskSymmetry
Q2 (2/2) @kibiklu: Would Pauli's Exclusion P hold? #AskSymmetry
Q2 (1/2) @kibiklu: Would two leptons be able to occupy the same quantum state if they were in different universes? #AskSymmetry
"A1: Even more more interesting, there could be huge universes inside  horizon of what just looks like a normal black hole 2/2 #AskSymmetry"
"A1: In principle yes, but we think  these kind of connections do not quite exist practically in nature (they are unstable) 1/2 #AskSymmetry"
Q1 @shiregator: are they connected via black hole wormholes? #AskSymmetry

"A10: More precise measurements also mean more chances to be surprised!  #asksymmetry 6/6"
A10: So they may be able to discover new physics - not only abt dark matter &amp; dark energy but also neutrinos and inflation. #asksymmetry 5/6
"A10: However, @desisurvey and @lsst will be dramatically more precise than existing measurements. #asksymmetry 4/6"

A10: Great question!  @sdsssurveys combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background and other measurements‚Ä¶  1/6 #asksymmetry
Q10 @Sorange29: #AskSymmetry What are the discoveries that DESI &amp; LSST (among others) will bring to us but DES and SDSS cannot/haven't yet?
.@desisurvey will measure both of these with one survey!
#darkenergy has two main effects on the universe: it impacts the expansion history and how fast structure (like galaxies and clusters) grows
"Scientists @SLAClab are also involved in the project @KIPAC1 https://t.co/dJsVTVhbQU"

"FYI, related news today @BerkeleyLab - The @desisurvey is entering construction, first light expected in 2019. https://t.co/VCW0KrZzM7"
"A9: Yep!  #darkmatter behaves just like normal matter does with gravity, but it doesn‚Äôt emit or absorb light. #AskSymmetry"
"Q9 @VineetWeaslly: Does Dark energy and Dark matter, follow the same rule, ordinary matter and energy follow? #AskSymmetry"
"A8: Yes, there are theories in which this is the case. So far no direct evidence for this, but it‚Äôs not totally ruled out. #AskSymmetry"
Q8 @shiregator: it would seem to me dark matter is just hidden in other dimensions.  Has that been ruled out? #AskSymmetry
A7: But recent results rule this out as all of the #darkmatter! 3/3  #AskSymmetry https://t.co/schxl2y85U

Q4: @toomanypaulos #AskSymmetry How does #darkmatter interact with other more familiar matter?
A3: Very unlikely!  Tho there are some theories that can transfer between dark energy and dark matter. #AskSymmetry
Q3 See R @thefirstarticl1: #AskSymmetry Can you convert dark mass into #darkenergy/energy like other energy with something like combustion?
"A2: But we are also looking at whether this might change with time, or whether GR needs to be modified on large scales. #AskSymmetry 3/3"
A2: The *simplest* possibility for what is accelerating the Universe is a cosmological constant. #AskSymmetry 2/3
A2: Actually we do consider this possibility very often! #AskSymmetry 1/3
"Q2 @joshamman: Why is no one considering that the equations might be wrong, and that dark matter doesnt exist? #AskSymmetry"
"A1: This is different from matter, which can only slow down the universe‚Äôs expansion. 8/8 #AskSymmetry"
"A1: We don‚Äôt understand exactly what #darkenergy is, but we know that it causes the universe‚Äôs expansion to accelerate. 7/8 #AskSymmetry"
"A1: It behaves differently: instead of attracting stuff, it seems to be a property of space that pushes other space away. 6/8 #AskSymmetry"
A1: #darkenergy is not matter at all. It makes up about 70% of of the universe. 5/8 #AskSymmetry
