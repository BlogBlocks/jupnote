Introduction 

The Book of Enoch (also 1 Enoch[l]) is an ancient Jewish religious work, ascribed to 

Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. It is not regarded as scripture by Jews or any 

Christian group, apart from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which to this day regards it 

to be canonical. 

Western scholars currently assert that its older sections (mainly in the Book of the 

Watchers) date from about 300 BC and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was 

composed at the end of the 1st century BC.[2] However, Ethiopian scholars generally 

hold that Ge'ez is the language of the original from which the Greek and Aramaic copies 

were made, pointing out that it is the only language in which the complete text has yet 

been found[3]. 

It is wholly extant only in the Ge'ez language, with Aramaic fragments from the Dead 

Sea Scrolls and a few Greek and Latin fragments. There is no consensus among 

Western scholars about the original language: some propose Aramaic, others Hebrew, 

while the probable thesis according to E. Isaac is that 1 Enoch, as Daniel, was composed 

partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew[4]:6. 

A short section of 1 Enoch (1 En 1:9) is quoted in the New Testament (Letter of Jude 

1:14-15), and there apparently attributed to "Enoch the Seventh from Adam" (lEn60:8). 

It is argued that all the writers of the New Testament were familiar with it and were 

influenced by it in thought and diction. [5] The first part of Book of Enoch describes the 

fall of the Watchers, the angels who fathered the Nephilim. The remainder of the book 

describes Enoch's visits to Heaven in the form of travels, visions and dreams, and his 

revelations. 

The book consists of five quite distinct major sections (see each section for details): 

The Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 1 - 36) 

The Book of Parables of Enoch (1 Enoch 37 - 71) (Also called the Similitudes of 

Enoch) 

The Astronomical Book (1 Enoch 72 - 82) (Also called the Book of the Heavenly 

Luminaries or Book of Luminaries. ) 

The Book of Dream Visions (1 Enoch 83 - 90) (Also called the Book of Dreams) 

The Epistle of Enoch (1 Enoch 91 - 108) 

The shared view[6] is that these five sections were originally independent works (with 
different dates of composition), themselves a product of much editorial arrangement, 
and were only later redacted into what we now call 1 Enoch. This view is now opposed 
only by a few authors who maintain the literary integrity of the Book of Enoch, one of 



the most recent (1990) being the Ethiopian Wossenie Yifru[3]. Jozef Milik has 
suggested that the Book of Giants found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls should be part of 
the collection, appearing after the Book of Watchers in place of the Book of Parables, 
but for various reasons Milik's theory has not been widely accepted. 

Canonicity in Judaism 

Although evidently widely known at the time of the Development of the Jewish Bible 
canon, lEnoch was excluded from both the formal canon of the Tanakh and the typical 
canon of the Septuagint and therefore also the writings known today as the 
Apocrypha.[7] [8] One possible reason for Jewish rejection of the book might be the 
textual nature of several early sections of the book which make use of material from the 
Torah, for example lEnl is a midrash of Deuteronomy 33. [9] [10]. The content, 
particularly detailed description of fallen angels, would also be a reason for rejection 
from the Hebrew canon at this period - as illustrated by the comments of Trypho the 
Jew when debating with Justin Martyr on this subject. Trypho: "The utterances of God 
are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been 
explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted 
from God." (Dialogue 79) [11]

Section I. Chapters I-XXXVI 
BOOK OF THE WATCHERS

.1 These are the words of the 

blessing of Enoch; according to which 
he blessed the chosen and righteous 
who must be present on the day of 
distress, which is appointed, for the 
removal of all the wicked and impious. 

1.2 And Enoch began his story and said: 

There was a righteous man whose eyes 
were opened by the Lord, and he saw a 
Holy vision in the Heavens, which the 
Angels showed to me. And I heard 
everything from them, and I understood 
what I saw: but not for this generation, 
but for a distant generation that will 
come. 

1.3 Concerning the Chosen I spoke; and 
I uttered a parable concerning them: 
The Holy and Great One will come out 
of his dwelling. 

1.4 And the Eternal God will tread from 
there upon Mount Sinai, and he will 
appear with his Host, and will appear in 
the strength of his power from Heaven. 

1.5 And all will be afraid, and the 
Watchers will shake, and fear and great 
trembling will seize them, up to the 
ends of the earth. 

1.6 And the high mountains will be 
shaken; and the high hills will be laid 
low and will melt like wax in a flame. 

1.7 And the earth will sink, and 
everything that is on the earth will be 
destroyed, and there will be judgment 
upon all, and upon all the righteous. 

1.8 But for the righteous: He will make 
peace, and He will keep safe the 
Chosen, and mercy will be upon them. 



They will all belong to God, and will 
prosper and be blessed, and the light of 
God will shine on them. 
1.9 And behold! He comes with ten 
thousand Holy Ones; to execute 
judgment upon them and to destroy the 
impious, and to contend with all flesh 
concerning everything that the sinners 
and the impious have done and wrought 
against Him.

10.4 And further the Lord said to 
Raphael: "Bind Azazel by his hands 
and his feet and throw him into the 
darkness. And split open the desert, 
which is in Dudael, and throw him 
there. 

10.5 And throw on him jagged and 
sharp stones and cover him with 
darkness. And let him stay there 
forever. And cover his face so that he 
may not see the light. 

10.6 And so that, on the Great Day of 
Judgment, he may be hurled into the 
fire. 

10.7 And restore the Earth which the 
Angels have ruined. And announce the 
restoration of the Earth. For I shall 
restore the Earth so that not all the sons 
of men shall be destroyed because of the 
knowledge which the Watchers made 
known and taught to their sons. 

10.8 And the whole Earth has been 
ruined by the teaching of the works of 
Azazel; and against him write: ALL 
SIN." 

10.9 And the Lord said to Gabriel: 
"Proceed against the bastards, and the 
reprobates, and against the sons of the 
fornicators. And destroy the sons of the 
fornicators, and the sons of the 
Watchers, from amongst men. And 
send them out, and send them against 
one another, and let them destroy 
themselves in battle; for they will not 
have length of days. 

10.10 And they will petition you, but 
the petitioners will gain nothing in 
respect of them, for they hope for 
eternal life, and that each of them will 
live life for five hundred years." 

10.11 And the Lord said to Michael: 
"Go, inform Semyaza, and the others 
with him, who have associated with the 
women to corrupt themselves with them 
in all their uncleanness. 

10.12 When all their sons kill each 
other, and when they see the destruction 
of their loved ones, bind them for 
seventy generations, under the hills of 



the earth, until the day of their judgment 
and of their consummation, until the 
judgment, which is for all eternity, is 
accomplished. 

10.13 And in those days, they will lead 
them to the Abyss of Fire; in torment, 
and in prison they will be shut up for all 
eternity. 

10.14 And then Semyaza will be burnt, 
and from then on destroyed with them; 
together they will be bound until the 
end of all generations. 

10.15 And destroy all the souls of lust, 
and the sons of the Watchers, for they 
have wronged men. 

10.16 Destroy all wrong from the face 
of the Earth and every evil work will 
cease. 

10.17 And now all the righteous will be 
humble, and will live until they beget 
thousands. And all the days of their 
youth, and their sabbaths, they will 
fulfill in peace. 

10.18 And in those days the whole earth 
will be tilled in righteousness and all of 
it will be planted with trees; and it will 
be filled with blessing. 

10.19 And all the pleasant trees they 
will plant on it and they will plant on it 
vines. And the vine that is planted on it 
will produce fruit in abundance; and 
every seed that is sown on it, each 
measure will produce a thousand, and 
each measure of olives will produce ten 
baths of oil. 

10.20 And you cleanse the Earth from 
all wrong, and from all iniquity, and 
from all sin, and from all impiety, and 
from all the uncleanness which is 
brought about on the earth. 

10.21 And all the sons of men shall be 
righteous, and all the nations shall serve 
and bless me and all shall worship me. 

10.22 And the Earth will be cleansed 
from all corruption, and from all sin, 
and from all wrath, and from all 
torment; and I will not again send a 
flood upon it, for all generations, 
forever.

14.3 As He has created, and appointed, 
men to understand the word of 
knowledge, so He created and appointed 
me to reprove the Watchers, the sons of 
Heaven. 

14.4 And I wrote out your petition, but 
in my vision, thus it appeared, that your 
petition would not be granted to you, for 
all the days of eternity; and complete 
judgment has been decreed against you, 
and you will not have peace. 

14.5 And from now on, you will not 
ascend into Heaven, for all eternity, and 
it has been decreed that you will be 
bound on Earth for all the days of 
eternity. 

14.6 And before this, you will have seen 
the destruction of your beloved sons, 
and you will not be able to enjoy them, 
but they will fall before you by the 
sword. 

14.7 And your petition will not be 
granted in respect of them or in respect 
of yourselves. And while you weep and 
supplicate you do not speak a single 
word from the writings which I have 
written. 

14.8 And the vision appeared to me, as 
follows: - Behold; clouds called me in 
the vision, and mist called me. And the 
path of the stars, and flashes of 
lightning, hastened me and drove me. 
And in the vision winds caused me to 
fly, and hastened me, and lifted me up 
into the sky. 

14.9 And I proceeded until I came near 
a wall which was made of hailstones, 
and a tongue of fire surrounded it, and it 
began to make me afraid. 

14.10 And I went into the tongue of fire 
and came near to a large house, which 
was built of hailstones, and the wall of 
that house was like a mosaic of 
hailstones and its floor was snow. 

14.11 Its roof was like the path of the 
stars and flashes of lightning, and 
among them was fiery cherubim, and 
their sky was like water. 

14.12 And there was a fire burning 
around its wall and its door was ablaze 



with fire. 

14.13 And I went into that house, and it 
was as hot as fire and as cold as snow, 
and there was neither pleasure nor life 
in it. Fear covered me and trembling 
took hold of me. 

14.14 And as I was shaking and 
trembling, I fell on my face. 

14.15 And I saw in the vision, and 
behold, another house which was larger 
than the former and all its doors were 
open before me, and it was built of a 
tongue of fire. 

14.16 And in everything, it so excelled 
in glory and splendor and size, so that I 
am unable to describe to you its glory 
and its size. 

14.17 And its floor was fire, and above 
lightning and the path of the stars, and 
its roof also was a burning fire. 

14.18 And I looked, and I saw in it, a 
high throne, and its appearance was like 
ice, and its surrounds like the shining 
Sun and the sound of cherubim. 

14.19 And from underneath the high 
throne there flowed out rivers of fire so 
that it was impossible to look at it. 

14.20 And He who is Great in Glory sat 
upon it, and his raiment was brighter 
than the Sun, and whiter than any snow. 

14.21 And no Angel could enter, and at 
the appearance of the face of Him who 
is Honoured and Praised, no creature of 
flesh could look. 

14.22 A sea of fire burnt around Him, 
and a great fire stood in front of Him, 
and none of those around Him came 
near to Him. Ten thousand times ten 
thousand stood before Him but He 
needed no Holy Council. 

14.23 And the Holy Ones who were 
near to Him did not leave by night or 
day and did not depart from Him. 

14.24 And until then I had a covering 
on my face, as I trembled. And the 
Lord called me with his own mouth, and 
said to me: "Come here, Enoch, to my 
Holy Word." 

14.25 And He lifted me up and brought 
me near to the door. And I looked, with 



my face down.

Z^Z^.X And from there, I went to 

another place, and he showed me in the 
west a large and high mountain, and a 
hard rock, and four beautiful places. 

22.2 And inside, it was deep, wide, and 
very smooth. How smooth is that which 
rolls, and deep and dark to look at! 

22.3 Then Raphael, one of the Holy 
Angels who was with me, answered me, 
and said to me: "These beautiful places 
are there so that the spirits, the souls of 
the dead, might be gathered into them. 
For them they were created; so that here 
they might gather the souls of the sons 
of men. 

22.4 And these places they made, where 
they will keep them until the Day of 
Judgment, and until their appointed 
time, and that appointed time will be 
long, until the great judgment comes 
upon them. 

22.5 And I saw the spirits of the sons of 
men who were dead and their voices 
reached Heaven and complained. 

22.6 Then I asked Raphael, the Angel 
who was with me, and said to him: 
"Whose is this spirit, whose voice thus 
reaches Heaven and complains?" 

22.7 And he answered me, and said to 
me, saying: "This spirit is the one that 
came out of Abel, whom Cain, his 
brother, killed. And he will complain 
about him until his offspring are 
destroyed from the face of the Earth, 
and from amongst the offspring of men. 



his offspring perish." Angels, w li o was w itl me, answered 

22.8 Then I asked about him, and about m e , a n d s a id to m e : " T li is b u rn in j f ire ,

Heaven rests, and the open Gates of 
Heaven.

come out, and counted the Gates out of 
which they come, and wrote down all 
their outlets, for each one, individually, 
according to their number. And their 
names, according to their constellations, 
their positions, their times, and their 
months, as the Angel Uriel, who was 
with me, showed me.

The First Parable. 



When the community of the righteous 
appears and the sinners are judged for 
their sins and are driven from the face 
of the dry ground. 

38.2 And when the Righteous One 
appears, in front of the chosen 
righteous, whose works are weighed by 
the Lord of Spirits. And when light 
appears to the righteous and chosen who 
dwell on the dry ground. Where will be 
the dwelling of the sinners? And where 
will be the resting-place of those who 
denied the Lord of Spirits? It would 
have been better for them, if they had 
not been born. 

38.3 And when the secrets of the 
righteous are revealed, the sinners will 
be judged, and the impious driven from 
the presence of the righteous and the 
chosen. 

38.4 And from then on, those who 
possess the earth will not be mighty and 
exalted. Nor will they be able to look at 
the face of the Holy ones, for the light 
of the Lord of the Spirits will have 
appeared on the face of the Holy, the 
righteous, and the chosen.

Parable . About those who deny the 
Name of the Dwelling of the Holy Ones 
and of the Lord of Spirits. 
45.2 They will not ascend into Heaven 
nor will they come upon the earth; such 
will be the lot of the sinners who deny 
the Name of the Lord of Spirits who 



will thus be kept for the Day of 
Affliction and Distress. 

45.3 "On that day the Chosen One will 
sit on the Throne of Glory and will 
choose their works. And their resting 
places will be without number and their 
spirits within them will grow strong 
when they see My Chosen One and 
those who appeal to My Holy and 
Glorious Name. 

45.4 And on that day I will cause My 
Chosen One to dwell among them and I 
will transform Heaven and make it an 
Eternal Blessing and Light. 

45.5 And I will transform the dry 
ground and make it a blessing, and I 
will cause My Chosen Ones to dwell 
upon it; but those who commit sin and 
evil will not tread upon it. 

45.6 For I have seen, and have satisfied 
with peace. My Righteous Ones, and 
have placed them in front of Me; but for 
the sinners My Judgement draws near 
so that I may destroy them from the face 
of the earth."

there will be rest on the earth and they

upon the dry ground. 

60.6 And when the Day, and the Power, 
and the Punishment, and the Judgment 
come that the Lord of Spirits has 
prepared for those who worship the 
Righteous Judgment, and for those who 
deny the Righteous Judgment, and for 
those who take His name in vain - and 
that Day has been prepared. For the 
chosen a covenant, but for the sinners a 
visitation." 

60.7 And on that day two monsters will 
be separated from one another, a female 
monster whose name is Leviathan, to 
dwell in the depths of the sea, above the 
springs of the waters. 

60.8 And the name of the male is 
Behemoth who occupies with his breast 
an immense desert named Dendayn on 
the east of the Garden where the chosen 
and the righteous dwell. Where my 
great-grandfather was received, who 
was seventh from Adam, the first man 
whom the Lord of Spirits made. 

60.9 And I asked that other Angel to 
show me the power of those monsters, 
how they were separated on one day, 
and thrown, one into the depths of the 
sea and the other on to the dry ground of 
the desert. 

60.10 And he said to me: "Son of man, 
you here wish to know what is secret." 

60. 1 1 And the other Angel spoke to me, 
the one who went with me and showed 
me what is secret; what is first and last 
in Heaven, in the heights, and under the 
dry ground, in the depths, and at the 
Ends of Heaven, and at the Foundations 
of Heaven, and in the Storehouses of the 
Winds. 

60.12 And how the spirits are 
distributed, and how they are weighed. 
And how the springs, and the winds, are 
counted according to the power of their 
spirit. And the power of the light of the 
Moon. And the divisions of the stars 
according to their names. And how all 
the divisions are made. 

60.13 And the thunder - according to 
the places were it falls. And all the 



divisions that are made in lightning - so 
that it may flash. And its hosts - how 
they quickly obey. 

60.14 For the thunder have fixed 
intervals, which have been given to its 
sound, for waiting. And the thunder 
and the lightning are not separate 
although not the same. Through a spirit 
the two of them move inseparably. 

60.15 For when the lightning flashes the 
thunder utters its voice, and the spirit, at 
the proper time, causes it to rest, and 
divides equally between them because 
the storehouse of the times for their 
occurrence is like that of the sand. And 
each of them, at the proper time, is held 
by a rein, and turned back by the power 
of the spirit, and likewise driven 
forward, according to the number of the 
regions of the Earth. 

60.16 And the spirit of the sea is male 
and strong, and according to the power

with a rein, and likewise it is driven 
forward, and scattered amongst all the 
mountains of the Earth. 

60.17 And the spirit of the hoarfrost is 
its own Angel; and the spirit of the hail, 
is a good Angel. 

60.18 And the spirit of the snow has 
withdrawn because of its power, and it 
has a special spirit, and that which rises 
from it is like smoke and its name is 
frost. 

60.19 And the spirit of the mist is not 
associated with them in their storehouse 
but has a special storehouse; for its 
course is glorious both in light and 
darkness, and in winter and in summer, 
and its storehouse is an Angel. 

60.20 The spirit of the dew has its 
dwelling at the ends of Heaven and is 
connected with the storehouses of the 
rain. And its course is in winter and in 
summer and its clouds. And the clouds 
of the mist are associated and one gives 
to the other.

the Angels of His Punishment to whom 
they have been handed over so that they 
might give them a little respite. And so 
that they might fall down and worship 
in front of the Lord of Spirits, and 
confess their sins in front of Him. 

63.2 And they will bless and praise the 
Lord of Spirits, and say: "Blessed be 
the Lord of Spirits, and the Lord of 
Kings, the Lord of the Mighty, and the 
Lord of the Rich, and the Lord of Glory, 
and the Lord of Wisdom! 

63.3 And everything secret is clear, in 
front of You, and your power is for all 
generations, and your glory is forever 
and ever. Deep and without number are 
all your secrets and your righteousness 
is beyond reckoning. 

63.4 Now we realize that we ought to 
praise and bless the Lord of Kings and 
the one who is King over all Kings." 

63.5 And they will say: "Would that we 
might be given a respite, so that we 
might praise and thank and bless him, 
and make our confession in front of His 
Glory. 

63.6 And now we long for a respite, but 
do not find it; we are driven off and do 
not obtain it; and the light has passed 
away from before us, and darkness will 
be our dwelling forever and ever. 

63.7 For we have not made our 
confession before him, and we have not 
praised the name of the Lord of Kings, 
and we have not praised the Lord for all 
his works, but our hopes have been on 
the sceptre of our kingdom, and of our 
glory. 

63.8 And on the day of our affliction 
and distress he does not save us, and we 
find no respite to make our confession 
that our Lord is faithful in all his 
doings, and in all his judgments and his 
justice, and that his judgments show no 
respect for persons. 

63.9 And we pass away from in front of 
him because of all our works and all our 
sins have been counted exactly." 

63.10 Then they will say to them: "Our 
souls are sated with possessions gained 



through iniquity, but they do not 
prevent our going down into the flames 
of the torment of Sheol." 

63.11 And after this their faces will be 
filled with darkness and shame, in front 
of that Son of Man, and they will be 
driven away from him. And the sword 
will dwell among them - in front of 
Him. 

63.12 And thus says the Lord of Spirits: 
"This is the Law and the Judgment for 
the mighty, and the kings, and the 
exalted, and for those who possess the 
dry ground, in front of the Lord of 
Spirits."

65.8 For lead and tin are not produced 
from the earth, like the former; there is a 
spring which produces them, and an 
Angel who stands in it, and that Angel 
distributes them." 

65.9 And after this, my great- 
grandfather Enoch took hold of me with 
his hand, and raised me, and said to me: 
"Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits 
about this disturbance on the earth." 

65.10 And he said to me: "Because of 
their iniquity, their judgment has been 
completed, and they will no longer be

65.11 And for these, there will be no 
place of refuge, for ever, for they 
showed to them what is secret, and they 
have been condemned; but not so for 
you, my son; the Lord of Spirits knows 
that you are pure and innocent of this 
reproach concerning the secrets.

67.8 And in those days, those waters 
will serve the kings, and the mighty, 
and the exalted, and those who dwell 
upon dry ground, for the healing of soul 
and body, but also for the punishment of 
the spirit. And their spirits are so full of 
lust that they will be punished in their 
bodies, for they denied the Lord of 
Spirits. And they see their punishment 
every day yet they do not believe in His 
Name. 

67.9 And the more their bodies are 
burnt, the more a change will come over 
their spirits, for ever and ever; for no 
one can speak an idle word in front of 
the Lord of Spirits. 

67.10 For judgment will come upon 
them, for they believe in the lust of their 
bodies, but deny the spirit of the Lord. 

67.11 And those same waters will 
undergo a change in those days; for 
when those Angels are punished in 
those days, the temperature of those 
springs of water will change, and when 
the Angels come up, that water of the 
springs will change, and become cold. 

67.12 And I heard the Holy Michael 
answering and saying: "This judgment, 
with which the Angels are judged, is a 
testimony for the kings and the mighty 
who possess the dry ground. 

67.13 For these waters of judgment 
serve for the healing of the bodies of the 
kings, and for the lust of their bodies; 
but they do not see, and do not believe, 
that these waters will change, and will 
become a fire which burns forever."

H .2 And b ell Id , tli e names of tli o se 
A J g e Is : ■ T li e first f ill e m is Semyaza 
(Azza), and the second Artaqifa, and 
the third Armen, and the fourth 
Kokabiel, and the fifth Turiel, and the 
sixth Ramiel, and the seventh Daniel, 
and the eighth Nuqael, and the ninth 
Baraqiel, and the tenth Azazel, and the 
eleventh Armaros, the twelfth Batriel, 
the thirteenth Basasael, the fourteenth 
Ananel, the fifteenth Turiel, the 
sixteenth Samsiel, the seventeenth 
Yetarel, the eighteenth Tumiel, the 
nineteenth Turiel, the twentieth 
Rumiel, the twenty-first Azazel. 

69.3 And these are the chiefs of their 
Angels, and the names of the leaders of 
hundreds, and their leaders of fifties, 
and their leaders of tens. 

69.4 The name of the first is Yequn; this 
is the one who led astray all the children 
of the Holy Angels, and he brought 
them down onto the dry ground, and led 



27 



them astray through the daughters of 
men. 

69.5 And the name of the second is 
Asbeel; this one suggested an evil plan 
to the children of the Holy Angels, and 
led them astray, so that they corrupted 
their bodies with the daughters of men. 

69.6 And the name of the third is 
Gadreel; this is the one that showed all 
the deadly blows to the sons of men. 
And he led astray Eve. And he showed 
the weapons of death to the children of 
men, the shield and the breastplate, and 
the sword for slaughter, and all the 
weapons of death to the sons of men. 

69.7 And from his hand they have gone 
out against those who dwell the dry 
ground from that time and forever and 
ever. 

69.8 And the name of the fourth is 
Penemue; this one showed the sons of 
men the bitter and the sweet and showed 
them all the secrets of their wisdom. 

69.9 He taught men the art of writing 
with ink and paper, and through this 
many have gone astray, from eternity to 
eternity, and to this day. 

69.10 For men were not created for this, 
that they should confirm their faith like 
this, with pen and ink. 

69.11 For men were created no 
differently from the Angels, so that they 
might remain righteous and pure, and 
death, which destroys everything, would 
not have touched them; but through this 
knowledge of theirs they are being 
destroyed and through this power death 
consumes them. 

69.12 And the name of the fifth is 
Kasdeyae; this one showed the sons of 
men all the evil blows of the spirits and 
of the demons, and the blows that attack 
the embryo in the womb so that it 
miscarries. And the blows that attack 
the soul: the bite of the serpent. And 
the blows that occur at midday, and the 
son of the serpent - who is strong. 

69.13 And this is the task of Kesbeel, 
the chief of the oath, who showed the 
oath to the Holy ones when he dwelt on 



high in glory. And his name is Beqa. 

69.14 And this one told the Holy 
Michael that he should show him the 
secret name so that they might mention 
it in the oath, so that those, who showed 
the sons of men everything that is 
secret, trembled before that name and 
oath. 

69.15 And this is the power of this oath, 
for it is powerful and strong, and he 
placed this oath, Akae, in the charge of 
the Holy Michael. 

69.16 And these are the secrets of this 
oath, and they are strong through this 
oath, and Heaven was suspended, before 
the world was created, and forever. 

69.17 And through it the earth was 
founded upon the water, and from the 
hidden recesses of the mountains come 
beautiful waters, from the creation of 
the world and for ever. 

69.18 And through that oath the sea was 
created, and as its foundation, for the 
time of anger, he placed for it the sand, 
and it does not go beyond it, from the 
creation of the world and for ever. 

69.19 And through that oath the deeps 
were made firm, and they stand and do 
not move from their place, from the 
creation of the world and for ever. 

69.20 And through that oath the Sun 
and the Moon complete their course and 
do not transgress their command, from 
the creation of the world and for ever. 

69.21 And through that oath the stars 
complete their course, and he calls their 
names, and they answer him, from the 
creation of the world and for ever. 

69.22 And likewise the spirits of the 
water, of the winds, and of all the 
breezes, and their paths, according to all 
the groups of the spirits. 

69.23 And there are kept the 
storehouses of the sound of thunder, and 
of the light of the lightning; and there 
are kept the storehouses of the hail, and 
the hoarfrost, and the storehouses of the 
mist, and the storehouses of the rain and 
dew. 

69.24 And all these make their 



28 



confession and give thanks in front of 
the Lord of Spirits and sing praises with 
all their power. And their food consists 
of all their thanksgiving and they give 
thanks, praise, and exalt, in the name of 
the Lord of Spirits, forever and ever. 

69.25 And this oath is strong over them 
and through it they are kept safe and 
their courses are not disturbed. 

69.26 And they had great joy and they 
blessed, praised, and exalted, because 
the name of that Son of Man had been 
revealed to them. 

69.27 And he sat on the Throne of His 
Glory and the whole judgment was 
given to the Son of Man and he will 
cause the sinners to pass away and be 
destroyed from the face of the Earth. 

69.28 And those who led astray the 
world will be bound in chains and will 
be shut up in the assembly-place of their 
destruction, and all their works will pass 
away from the face of the earth. 

69.29 And from then on there will be 
nothing corruptible. For that Son of 
Man has appeared, and has sat on the 
Throne of His Glory, and everything 
evil will pass away and go from in front 
of Him; and the word of that Son of 
Man will be strong in front of the Lord 
of Spirits. 

This is the Third Parable of Enoch.

71.13 And that Head of Days came with 
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel,

Angels without number. 

71.14 And that Angel, came to me, and 
greeted me with his voice, and said to 
me: "You are the son of man who was 
born to righteousness and righteousness 
remains over you and the righteousness 
of the Head of Days, will not leave 
you." 

71.15 And he said to me: "He 
proclaims peace to you in the name of 
the world which is to come, for from 
there peace has come out from the 
creation of the world and so you will 
have it for ever and for ever and ever. 

71.16 And all will walk according to 
your way, inasmuch as righteousness 
will never leave you. With you will be 
their dwelling, and with you their lot, 
and they will not be separated from you 
for ever and for ever and ever. 

71.17 And so there will be length of 
days with that Son of Man, and the 
righteous will have peace, and the 
righteous will have an upright way in 
the name of the Lord of Spirits, for ever 
and ever."

The Book of the Heavenly 

Luminaries 

/ Ai.\ The Book of the Revolutions 

of the Lights of Heaven. 

Each as it is; according to their classes, 
according to their period of rule and 
their times, according to their names 
and places of origin, and according to 
their months. That Uriel, the Holy 
Angel who was with me, and is their 
leader, showed to me. And he showed 
me all their regulations, exactly as they 
are, for each year of the world and for 
ever, until the new creation shall be 
made which will last forever. 

72.2 And this is the First Law of the 
Lights. The light called the Sun; its 
rising is in the Gates of Heaven that are 
towards the east, and its setting is in the 
western Gates of Heaven. 

72.3 And I saw six Gates from which 
the Sun rises, and six Gates in which the 
Sun sets, and the Moon also rises and 
sets in those Gates, and the leaders of 
the stars together with those whom they 
lead. There are six in the east and six in 
the west, all exactly in place, one next 
to the other; and there are many 
windows to the south and the north of 
those Gates. 

72.4 And first there rises the greater 
light, named the Sun, and its disc is like 
the disc of Heaven, and the whole of it 
is full of a fire which gives light and 
warmth. 

72.5 The wind blows the chariots on 
which it ascends, and the Sun goes 
down in the sky and returns through the 
north in order to reach the east, and is 
led so that it comes to the appropriate 
Gate and shines in the sky. 

72.6 In this way it rises in the first 



30 



month, in the large Gate, namely; it 
rises through the fourth of those six 
Gates that are towards the east. 

72.7 And in that fourth Gate, through 
which the Sun rises in the first month, 
there are twelve window-openings from 
which, whenever they are opened, 
flames come out. 

72.8 When the Sun rises in Heaven it 
goes out through that fourth Gate for 
thirty days, and exactly in the fourth 
Gate, in the west of Heaven, it goes 
down. 

72.9 And in those days the day grows 
daily longer, and the night grows 
nightly shorter, until the thirtieth 
morning. 

72.10 And on that day the day becomes 
longer than the night by a double part, 
and the day amounts to exactly ten 
parts, and the night amounts to eight 
parts. 

72. 1 1 And the Sun rises from that fourth 
Gate, and sets in the fourth Gate, and 
returns to the fifth Gate in the east for 
thirty mornings; and it rises from it and 
sets in the fifth Gate. 

72.12 And then the day becomes longer 
by two parts, and the day amounts to 
eleven parts, and the night becomes 
shorter and amounts to seven parts. 

72.13 And the Sun returns to the east 
and comes to the sixth Gate, and rises 
and sets in the sixth Gate for thirty-one 
mornings, because of its sign. 

72.14 And on that day the day becomes 
longer than the night, and the day 
becomes double the night; and the day 
amounts to twelve parts, and the night 
becomes shorter and amounts to six 
parts. 

72.15 And the Sun rises up so that the 
day may grow shorter, and the night 
longer; and the Sun returns to the east, 
and comes to the sixth Gate, and rises 
from it, and sets, for thirty mornings. 

72.16 And when thirty mornings have 
been completed the day becomes 
shorter, by exactly one part; and the day 
amounts to eleven parts, and the night to 



seven parts. 

72.17 And the Sun goes out from the 
west, through that sixth Gate, and goes 
to the east, and rises in the fifth Gate for 
thirty mornings and it sets in the west 
again, in the fifth Gate in the west. 

72.18 On that day the day becomes 
shorter by two parts, and the day 
amounts to ten parts, and the night to 
eight parts. 

72.19 And the Sun rises from that fifth 
Gate, and sets in the fifth Gate in the 
west, and rises in the fourth Gate for 
thirty-one mornings because of its sign, 
and sets in the west. 

72.20 On that day the day becomes 
equal with the night, and is of equal 
length; and the night amounts to nine 
parts, and the day to nine parts. 

72.21 And the Sun rises from that Gate 
and sets in the west, and returns to the 
east, and rises in the third Gate for thirty 
mornings, and sets in the west in the 
third Gate. 

72.22 And the Sun rises from that third 
Gate, and sets in the third Gate in the 
west, and returns to the east; and the 
Sun rises in the second Gate in the east 
for thirty mornings, and likewise, it sets 
in the second Gate, in the west of 
Heaven. 

72.24 And on that day the night 
amounts to eleven parts and the day to 
seven parts. 

72.25 And the Sun rises, on that day, 
from the second Gate, and sets in the 
west in the second Gate, and returns to 
the east to the first Gate for thirty-one 
mornings, then sets in the west in the 
first Gate. 

72.26 And on that day the night 
becomes longer, and becomes double 
the day; and the night amounts to 
exactly twelve parts, and the day to six 
parts. 

72.27 And with this, the Sun has 
completed the divisions of its journey, 
and it turns back again, along these 
divisions of its journey; and it comes 
through that first Gate for thirty 



31 



mornings, and sets in the west opposite 7 3,2 Aid ils disc is lilte tli e disc of tli e

32 



makes all its light full, in the east and in 
the west. 

74.4 And in certain months, it changes 
its setting, and in certain months, it 
follows its own individual course. 

74.5 In two months it sets with the Sun, 
in those two Gates that are in the 
middle, in the third and in the fourth 
Gate. 

74.6 It goes out for seven days and turns 
back, and returns again to the Gate from 
which the Sun rises. And in that Gate it 
makes all its light full, and it recedes 
from the Sun, and comes, in eight days, 
to the sixth Gate from which the Sun 
rises. 

74.7 And when the Sun rises from the 
fourth Gate, the Moon goes out for 
seven days, until it rises from the fifth 
Gate. And again it returns in seven days 
to the fourth Gate, makes all its light 
full, recedes, and comes to the first Gate 
in eight days. 

74.8 And again it returns in seven days 
to the fourth Gate from which the Sun 
rises. 

74.9 Thus I saw their positions; how the 
Moon rose and the Sun set in those 
days. 

74.10 And if five years are added 
together, the Sun has an excess of thirty 
days. For each year, of the five years, 
there are three hundred and sixty four 
days. 

74.11 And the excess, of the Sun and 
the stars, comes to six days. In five 
years, with six days each, they have an 
excess of thirty days, and the Moon falls 
behind the Sun and the stars by thirty 
days. 

74.12 And the Moon conducts the years 
exactly, all of them according to their 
eternal positions; they are neither early 
nor late, even by one day, but change 
the year in exactly 364 days. 

74.13 In three years, there are 1,092 
days, and in five years 1,820 days, so 
that in eight years there are 2,912 days. 

74.14 For the Moon alone, the days in 
three years come to 1,062 days, and in 



five years it is fifty days behind. 

74.15 And there are 1,770 days in five 
years so that for the Moon the days in 
eight years amount to 2,832 days. 

74.16 For the difference in eight years is 
eighty days, and all the days that the 
Moon is behind, in eight years, are 
eighty days. 

74.17 And the year is completed 
exactly, in accordance with their 
positions, and the positions of the Sun, 
in that they rise from the Gates from 
which the Sun rises and sets for thirty 
days.

75.5 And there are openings for the 
winds, and for the spirit of the dew, 
when they are opened at their times, 
opened in Heaven, at the ends of the 
earth. 

75.6 I saw twelve Gates in Heaven, at 
the ends of the earth, from which the 
Sun, and the Moon, and the stars, and 
all the works of Heaven, go out in the 
east and in the west. 

75.7 And there are many window- 
openings to the north and to the south, 
and each window, at its appointed time, 
sends out heat corresponding to those 
Gates, from which the stars go out, in 
accordance with His command to them, 
and in which they set according to their 
number. 

75.8 And I saw chariots in Heaven, 
running through the region above those 
Gates, in which the stars that never set 
rotate.

others. And it goes round through the 
whole world.

And he said to me: "Oh Enoch, 

look at the book of the Tablets of 
Heaven and read what is written upon 
them, and note every individual fact." 

81.2 And I looked at everything that 
was written and I noted everything. 
And I read the book and everything that 
was written in it, all the deeds of men, 
and all the children of flesh who will be 
upon the Earth, for all the generations of 
eternity. 

81.3 And then I immediately blessed the 
Lord, the Eternal King of Glory, in that 
he has made all the works of the world, 
and I praised the Lord because of his 
patience, and I blessed him on account 
of the sons of Adam. 

81.4 And at that time I said: "Blessed is 
the man who dies righteous and good, 
concerning whom no book of iniquity 
has been written, and against whom no 
guilt has been found." 

81.5 And these three Holy ones brought 
me and set me on the earth in front of 
the door of my house, and said to me: 
"Tell everything to your son 
Methuselah, and show all your children 
that no flesh is righteous, before the 
Lord, for He created them. 

81.6 For one year we will leave you 
with your children, until you have 
regained your strength, so that you may 
teach your children and write these 
things down for them, and testify to all 
your children. And in the second year 
we will take you from amongst them. 

81.7 Let your heart be strong, for the 
good will proclaim righteousness to the 
good, the righteous will rejoice with the 
righteous and they will wish each other 
well. 

81.8 But the sinner will die with the 
sinner and the apostate will sink with 
the apostate. 

81.9 And those who practice 
righteousness will die because of the 
deeds of men, and will be gathered in 
because of the deeds of the impious." 



81.10 And in those days they finished 
speaking to me and I went to my family 
as I blessed the Lord of Ages.

82.4 Blessed are all the righteous, 
blessed are all those who walk in the 
way of righteousness and do not sin like 
the sinners. 

In the numbering of all their days in 
which the Sun journeys in Heaven, 
coming in and out, through the Gates of 
Heaven, for thirty days. 
With the leaders of the thousands, of 
this order of stars, and with the four 
which are added, and divided between 
the four seasons of the year, which lead 
them and appear with them on four 
days. 

82.5 Because of them men go wrong, 
and they do not reckon them in the 
reckoning of the whole year; for men go 
wrong in respect of them and do not 
know them exactly. 

82.6 For they belong in the reckoning of 
the year, and are truly recorded forever, 
one in the first Gate, and one in the 
third, and one in the fourth and one in 
the sixth. And the year is completed in 
364 days. 



37 



82.7 And the account of it is true, and 
the recorded reckoning of it is exact, for 
the lights, and the months, and the 
feasts, and the years, and the days. 
Uriel showed me, and inspired me; he to 
whom the Lord of the whole created 
world gave commands about the Host of 
Heaven for me. 

82.8 And he has power in Heaven, over 
night and day, to cause light to shine on 
men; the Sun, the Moon, and the stars, 
and all the Powers of Heaven, which 
rotate in their orbits. 

82.9 And this is the Law of the Stars, 
which set in their places, at their times, 
and at their feasts, and in their months. 

82.10 And these are the names of those 
who lead them, who keep watch, so that 
they appear at their times, and in their 
orders, and in their months, and in their 
periods of rule, and in their positions. 

82.11 Their four leaders, who divide the 
four parts of the year, appear first; and 
after them the twelve leaders of the 
orders, who divide the months and the 
years into 364 days, with the heads over 
thousands, who separate the days. And 
for the four days, that are added to 
them, there are the leaders who separate 
the four parts of the year. 

82.12 And as for these heads over 
thousands, one is added between the 
leader and the led, but their leaders 
make the separation. 

82.13 And these are the names of the 
leaders who separate the four appointed 
parts of the year: Melkiel, Helemmelek, 
Meleyal, and Narel. 

82.14 And the names of those whom 
they lead: Adnarel, lyasusael, lylumiel; 
these three follow behind the leaders of 
the orders. And all others follow behind 
the three leaders of the orders, who 
follow behind those leaders of positions, 
who separate the four parts of the year. 

82.15 In the beginning of the year, 
Melkiel rises first and rules, who is 
called the southern Sun - and all the 
days of his period, during which he 
rules, are ninety-one. 



82.16 And these are the signs of the 
days that are to be seen on the earth, in 
the days of his period of rule; sweat, and 
heat, and calm. And all the trees bear 
fruit, and leaves appear on all the trees, 
and the wheat harvest, and rose flowers. 
And all the flowers bloom in the field 
but the trees of winter are withered. 

82.17 And these are the names of the 
leaders who are under them: Berkeel, 
Zelebsael, and another one who is 
added, a head over a thousand, named 
Heloyaseph. And the days of the period 
of rule, of this one, are complete. 

82.18 The second leader, after him, is 
Helemmelec, whom they call the 
Shining Sun; and all the days of his 
light are ninety-one. 

82.19 And these are the signs of the 
days on earth: heat, and drought. And 
the trees bring their fruit to ripeness and 
maturity and make their fruit dry. And 
the sheep mate and become pregnant. 
And men gather all the fruits of the 
earth, and everything that is in the 
fields, and the vats of wine. And these 
things occur in the days of his period of 
rule. 

82.20 And these are the names, and the 
orders, and the leaders of these heads 
over thousands: Gedaeyal, Keel, and 
Heel. And the name of the head-over-a- 
thousand, who is added to them, is 
Asfael. And the days of his period of 
rule are complete.

with it amongst the wolves, and they 
increased and became many flocks of 
sheep. 

89.15 And the wolves began to make 
them afraid, and they oppressed them 
until they made away with their young, 
and then they threw their young into a 
river with much water; but those sheep 
began to cry out because of their young, 
and to complain to their Lord. 

89.16 But a sheep, which had been 
saved from the wolves, fled and escaped 
to the wild asses. And I saw the sheep 
moaning and crying out, and petitioning 
the Lord with all their power, until that 
Lord of the sheep came down at the call 
of the sheep, from a high room, and 
came to them, and looked at them. 

89.17 And he called that sheep, which 
had fled from the wolves, and spoke to 
it about the wolves, that it should warn 
them that they should not touch the 
sheep. 

89.18 And the sheep went to the 
wolves, in accordance with the Word of 
the Lord, and another sheep met that 
sheep and went with it. And the two of 
them together, entered the assembly of 
those wolves, spoke to them, and 
warned them that from then on, they 
should not touch those sheep. 

89.19 And after this, I saw the wolves, 
how they acted even more harshly 
towards the sheep, with all their power, 
and the sheep called out. 

89.20 And their Lord came to the sheep 
and began to beat those wolves; and the 
wolves began to moan, but the sheep 
became silent and from then on they did 
not cry out. 

89.21 And I looked at the sheep until 
they escaped from the wolves; but the 
eyes of the wolves were blinded, and 
those wolves went out in pursuit of the 
sheep with all their forces. 

89.22 And the Lord of the sheep went 
with them, as he led them, and all his 
sheep followed him; and his face was 
glorious, and his appearance terrible and 
magnificent. 



89.23 But the wolves began to pursue 
those sheep until they met them by a 
stretch of water. 

89.24 And that stretch of water was 
divided, and the water stood on one 
side, and on the other, before them. 
And their Lord as he led them, stood 
between them and the wolves. 

89.25 And while those wolves had not 
yet seen the sheep, they went into the 
middle of that stretch of water; but the 
wolves pursued the sheep, and those 
wolves ran after them into that stretch of 
water. 

89.26 But when they saw the Lord of 
the sheep they turned to flee in front of 
him; but that stretch of water flowed 
together again, and suddenly resumed 
its natural form, and the water swelled 
up, and rose until it covered those 
wolves. 

89.27 And I looked until all the wolves 
that had pursued those sheep were 
destroyed and drowned. 

89.28 But the sheep escaped that water, 
and went to a desert, where there was 
neither water, nor grass. And they 
began to open their eyes and see, and I 
saw the Lord of the sheep pasturing 
them, and giving them water and grass, 
and that sheep going and leading them. 

89.29 And that sheep went up to the 
summit of a high rock and the Lord of 
the sheep sent it to them. 

89.30 And after this, I saw the Lord of 
the sheep standing before them, and his 
appearance was terrible and majestic, 
and all those sheep saw him and were 
afraid of him. 

89.31 And all of them were afraid and 
trembled before him; and they cried out 
to that sheep, with those who were in 
their midst: "We cannot stand before 
our Lord nor look at him." 

89.32 And that sheep, which led them, 
again went up to the summit of that 
rock; and the sheep began to be blinded, 
and go astray from the path which had 
been shown to them, but that sheep did 
not know. 



42 



89.33 And the Lord of the sheep was 
extremely angry with them, and that 
sheep knew, and went down from the 
summit of the rock, and came to the 
sheep, and found the majority of them, 
with their eyes blinded, and going 
astray from his path. 

89.34 And when they saw it they were 
afraid and trembled before it and wished 
that they could return to their enclosure. 
And that sheep took some other sheep 
with it, and went to those sheep that had 
gone astray, and then began to kill 
them; and the sheep were afraid of it. 
And that sheep brought back those 
sheep that had gone astray, and they 
returned to their enclosures. 

89.36 And I looked there at the vision, 
until that sheep became a man, and built 
a house for the Lord of the sheep, and 
made all the sheep stand in that house. 

89.37 And I looked until that sheep, 
which had met that sheep that led the 
sheep, fell asleep. And I looked until all 
the large sheep were destroyed and 
small ones arose in their place, and they 
came to a pasture, and drew near a river 
of water. 

89.38 And that sheep that led them, 
which had become a man, separated 
from them and fell asleep, and all the 
sheep sought it, and cried out very 
bitterly over it. 

89.39 And I looked until they left off 
crying for that sheep, and crossed that 
river of water. And there arose all the 
sheep that led them, in place of those 
which had fallen asleep; and they led. 

89.40 And I looked until the sheep came 
to a good place and a pleasant and 
glorious land, and I looked until those 
sheep were satisfied. And that house 
was in the middle of them in that green 
and pleasant land. 

89.41 And sometimes their eyes were 
opened, and sometimes blinded, until 
another sheep rose up, led them, and 
brought them all back. And their eyes 
were opened. 

89.42 And the dogs, and the foxes, and 



the wild boars, began to devour those 
sheep until the Lord of the sheep raised 
up a ram from among them, which led 
them. 

89.43 And that ram began to butt those 
dogs, foxes, and wild boars, on one side 
and on the other until it had destroyed 
them all. 

89.44 And the eyes of that sheep were 
opened, and it saw that ram in the 
middle of the sheep, how it renounced 
its glory, and began to butt those sheep, 
and how it trampled on them and 
behaved unbecomingly. 

89.45 And the Lord of the sheep sent 
the sheep to another sheep and raised it 
up to be a ram and to lead the sheep in 
place of that sheep which had 
renounced its glory. 

89.46 And it went to it, and spoke with 
it alone, and raised up that ram, and 
made it the prince and leader of the 
sheep. And, during all this, those dogs 
oppressed the sheep. 

89.47 And the first ram pursued that 
second ram and that second ram rose 
and fled before it. And I looked until 
those dogs made the first ram fall. 

89.48 And that second ram rose up and 
led the small sheep, and that ram begat 
many sheep, and fell asleep. And a 
small sheep became a ram, in place of 
it, and became the prince and leader of 
those sheep. 

89.49 And those sheep grew and 
increased; but all the dogs, and foxes, 
and wild boars, were afraid and fled 
from it. And that ram butted and killed 
all the animals, and those animals did 
not again prevail amongst the sheep, 
and did not seize anything further from 
them. 

89.50 And that house became large and 
broad, and for those sheep a high tower 
was built on that house for the Lord of 
the sheep. And that house was low but 
the tower was raised up and high. And 
the Lord of the sheep stood on that 
tower and they spread a full table before 
him. 



43 



89.51 And I saw those sheep again, how 
they went astray, and walked in many 
ways, and left that house of theirs; and 
the Lord of the sheep called some of the 
sheep, and sent them to the sheep, but 
the sheep began to kill them. 

89.52 But one of them was saved, and 
was not killed, and it sprang away and 
cried out against the sheep. And they 
wished to kill it but the Lord of the 
sheep saved it from the hands of the 
sheep, brought it up to me, and made it 
stay. 

89.53 And he sent many other sheep to 
those sheep, to testify to them and to 
lament over them. 

89.54 And after this, I saw how when 
they left the house of the Lord of the 
sheep, and his tower, they went astray in 
everything, and their eyes were blinded. 
And I saw how the Lord of the sheep 
wrought much slaughter among them, in 
their pastures, until those sheep invited 
that slaughter, and betrayed his place. 

89.55 And he gave them into the hands 
of the lions, and the tigers, and the 
wolves, and the hyenas, and into the 
hands of the foxes, and to all the 
animals. And those wild animals began 
to tear those sheep in pieces. 

89.56 And I saw how he left that house 
of theirs, and their tower, and gave them 
all into the hands of the lions so that 
they might tear them in pieces and 
devour them, and into the hands of all 
the animals. 

89.57 And I began to cry out with all 
my power, to call the Lord of the sheep, 
and to represent to him concerning the 
sheep; that all the wild animals were 
devouring them. 

89.58 But he remained still, although he 
saw, and he rejoiced that they were 
devoured, swallowed up and carried off. 
And he gave them into the hands of all 
the animals for food. 

89.59 And he called seventy shepherds, 
and cast off those sheep, so that they 
might pasture them. And he said to the 
shepherds and to their companions: 



"Each one of you, from now on, is to 
pasture the sheep and do whatever I 
command you. 

89.60 And I will hand them over to you, 
duly numbered, and I will tell you 
which of them are to be destroyed, and 
destroy them." And he handed those 
sheep over to them. 

89.61 And he called another, and said to 
him: "Observe and see everything that 
these shepherds do against these sheep 
for they will destroy from among them 
more than I have commanded them. 

89.62 And write down all the excess 
and destruction, which is wrought by 
the shepherds; how many they destroy 
at my command and how many they 
destroy of their own volition. Write 
down against each shepherd, 
individually, all that he destroys. 

89.63 And read out in front of me 
exactly how many they destroy of their 
own volition and how many are handed 
over for destruction so that this may be 
a testimony for me against them. So 
that I may know all the deeds of the 
shepherds in order to hand them over 
for judgment. And I will see what they 
do, whether they abide by my command 
with which I have commanded them, or 
not. 

89.64 But they must not know this, and 
you must not show this to them, but 
only write down against each individual 
in his time all that the shepherds 
destroy, and bring it all up to me." 

89.65 And I looked until those 
shepherds pastured at their times, and 
they began to kill and destroy more than 
they were commanded, and they gave 
those sheep into the hands of the lions. 

89.66 And the lions and the tigers 
devoured and swallowed up the 
majority of those sheep, and the wild 
boars devoured with them; and they 
burnt down that tower and demolished 
that house. 

89.67 And I was extremely sad about 
that tower because that house of the 
sheep had been demolished; and after 



44 



that I was unable to see whether those 
sheep went into that house. 

89.68 And the shepherds and their 
companions handed those sheep over to 
all the animals so that they might 
devour them. Each one of them, at his 
time, received an exact number, and for 
each of them, one after the other, there 
was written in a book how many of 
them were destroyed. 

89.69 And each one killed and 
destroyed more than was prescribed and 
I began to weep and moan very much 
because of those sheep. 

89.70 And likewise, in the vision, I saw 
that one who wrote, how each day, he 
wrote down each one that was destroyed 
by those shepherds. And he brought up, 
and presented, the whole book to the 
Lord of the sheep, everything they had 
done and all that each one of them had 
made away with, and all that they had 
handed to destruction. 

89.71 And the book was read out in 
front of the Lord of the sheep, and he 
took the book in his hand, read it, sealed 
it, and put it down. 

89.72 And after this I saw how the 
shepherds pastured for twelve hours, 
and behold three of those sheep 
returned, and arrived, and came and 
began to build up all that had fallen 
down from that house; but the wild 
boars hindered them so that they could 
not. 

89.73 And they again began to build, as 
before, and they raised up that tower, 
and it was called the high tower. And 
they began again to place a table before 
the tower but all the bread on it was 
unclean and was not pure. 

89.74 And, besides all this, the eyes of 
these sheep were blinded so that they 
could not see, and their shepherds 
likewise. And they handed yet more of 
them over to destruction, and they 
trampled on the sheep with their feet, 
and devoured them. 

89.75 But the Lord of the sheep 
remained still, until all the sheep were 



scattered abroad, and had mixed with 
them, and they did not save them from 
the hands of the animals. 

89.76 And that one who wrote the book 
brought it up, showed it, and read it out 
in the dwelling of the Lord of the sheep. 
And he entreated Him on behalf of 
them, and petitioned Him, as he showed 
Him all the deeds of their shepherds and 
testified in front of Him against all the 
shepherds. 

89.77 And he took the book, put it down 
by Him, and went out.

and did not listen to what they said to 
them, but were extremely deaf, and their 
eyes were extremely and excessively 
blinded. 

90.8 And I saw in the vision, how the 
ravens flew upon those lambs, and took 
one of those lambs, and dashed the 
sheep in pieces and devoured them. 

90.9 And I looked until horns came up 
on those lambs but the ravens cast their 
horns down. And I looked until a big 
horn grew on one of those sheep, and 
their eyes were opened. 

90.10 And it looked at them and their 
eyes were opened. And it cried to the 
sheep, and the rams saw it, and they all 
ran to it. 

90.11 And, besides all this, those eagles, 
and vultures, and ravens, and kites, were 
still continually tearing the sheep in 
pieces, and flying upon them and 
devouring them. And the sheep were 
silent but the rams lamented and cried 
out. 

90.12 And those ravens battled and 
fought with it, and wished to make 
away with its horn, but they did not 
prevail against it. 

90.13 And I looked at them until the 
shepherds and the eagles, and those 
vultures, and kites, came and cried to 
the ravens that they should dash the 
horn of that ram in pieces. And they 
fought and battled with it, and it fought 
with them and cried out so that its help 
might come to it. 

90.14 And I looked until that man, who 
wrote down the names of the shepherds 
and brought them up before the Lord of 
the sheep, came, and he helped that ram 
and showed it everything; its help was 
coming down. 

90.15 And I looked until that Lord of 
the sheep came to them in anger, all 
those who saw him fled, and they all 
fell into the shadow in front of Him. 

90.16 All the eagles and vultures and 
ravens and kites, gathered together and 
brought with them all the wild sheep, 
and they all came together and helped 



one another in order to dash that horn of 
the ram in pieces. 

90.17 And I looked at that man, who 
wrote the book at the command of the 
Lord, until he opened that book of the 
destruction that those last twelve 
shepherds had wrought. And he 
showed, in front of the Lord of the 
sheep, that they had destroyed even 
more than those before them had. 

90.18 And I looked until the Lord of the 
sheep came to them and took the Staff 
of His Anger and struck the Earth. And 
the Earth was split. And all the animals, 
and the birds of the sky, fell from those 
sheep and sank in the earth; and it 
closed over them. 

90.19 And I looked until a big sword 
was given to the sheep. And the sheep 
went out against all the wild animals to 
kill them. And all the animals, and 
birds of the sky, fled before them. 

90.20 And I looked until a throne was 
set up in a pleasant land and the Lord of 
the sheep sat on it. And they took all 
the sealed books and opened the books 
in front of the Lord of the sheep. 

90.21 And the Lord called those men, 
the seven first white ones, and 
commanded them to bring in front of 
Him the first star, which went before 
those stars whose private parts were like 
horses, and they brought them all in 
front of Him. 

90.22 And He said to that man who 
wrote in front of Him, who was one of 
the seven white ones. He said to him: 
"Take those seventy shepherds, to 
whom I handed over the sheep, and 
who, on their own authority, took and 
killed more than I commanded them." 

90.23 And behold, I saw them all 
bound, and they all stood in front of 
Him. 

90.24 And the judgment was held, first 
on the stars, and they were judged and 
found guilty, and they went to the place 
of damnation, and were thrown into a 
deep place full of fire burning, and full 
of pillars of fire. 



46 



90.25 And those seventy shepherds 
were judged, and found guilty, and they 
also were thrown into that abyss of fire. 

90.26 And I saw at that time, how a 
similar abyss was opened in the middle 
of the Earth which was full of fire, and 
they brought those blind sheep and they 
were all judged, and found guilty, and 
thrown into that abyss of fire and they 
burned. And that abyss was on the 
south of that house. 

90.27 And I saw those sheep burning 
and their bones were burning. 

90.28 And I stood up to look until he 
folded up that old house, and they 
removed all the pillars, and all the 
beams and ornaments of that house 
were folded up with it. And they 
removed it and put it in a place in the 
south of the land. 

90.29 And I looked until the Lord of the 
sheep brought a new house, larger and 
higher than the first one, and he set it up 
on the site of the first one that had been 
folded up. And all its pillars were new, 
and its ornaments were new and larger 
than those of the first one - the old one 
that had been removed. And the Lord 
of the sheep was in the middle of it. 

90.30 And I saw all the sheep that were 
left, and all the animals of the earth, and 
all the birds of the sky, falling down and 
worshipping those sheep, and entreating 
them and obeying them in every 
command. 

90.31 And after this, those three who 
were dressed in white and had taken 
hold of my hand, the ones who had 
brought me up at first. They, with the 
hand of that ram also holding me, took 
me up, and put me down in the middle 
of those sheep before the judgment was 
held. 

90.32 And those sheep were all white 
and their wool thick and pure. 

90.33 And all those which had been 
destroyed and scattered, and all the wild 
animals, and all the birds of the sky, 
gathered together in that house, and the 
Lord of the sheep rejoiced very much 



because they were all good, and had 
returned to His house. 

90.34 And I looked until they had laid 
down that sword, which had been given 
to the sheep, and they brought it back 
into his house, and it was sealed in front 
of the Lord. And all the sheep were 
enclosed in that house but it did not 
hold them. 

90.35 And the eyes of all of them were 
opened, and they saw well, and there 
was not one among them that did not 
see. 

90.36 And I saw that that house was 
large, broad, and exceptionally full. 

90.37 And I saw how a white bull was 
bom, and its homs were big, and all the 
wild animals, and all the birds of the 
sky, were afraid of it, and entreated it 
continually. 

90.38 And I looked until all their 
species were transformed and they all 
became white bulls. And the first 
among them was a wild-ox. And that 
wild-ox was a large animal and had big 
black horns on its head. And the Lord 
of the sheep rejoiced over them, and 
over all the bulls. 

90.39 And I was asleep in the middle of 
them and I woke up and saw everything. 

90.40 And this is the vision which I saw 
while I was asleep, and I woke up, 
blessed the Lord of Righteousness, and 
ascribed glory to him. 

90.41 But after this I wept bitterly and 
my tears did not stop until I could not 
endure it. When I looked, they ran 
down, because of what I saw, for 
everything will come to pass and be 
fulfilled, and all the deeds of men, in 
their order, were shown to me. 

90.42 That night I remembered my first 
dream, and because of it I wept, and 
was disturbed, because I had seen that 
vision.

righteousness, and a sword will be 
given to it so that the Righteous 
Judgment may be executed on those 
who do wrong, and the sinners will be 
handed over into the hands of the 
righteous. 

91.13 And, at its end, they will acquire 
Houses because of their righteousness, 
and a House will be built for the Great 
King in Glory, forever. 

91.14 And after this, in the ninth week, 
the Righteous Judgment will be 
revealed to the whole world. And all 
the deeds of the impious will vanish 
from the whole Earth. And the world 
will be written down for destruction and 
all men will look to the Path of 
Uprightness. 

91.15 And, after this, in the tenth week, 
in the seventh part, there will be an 
Eternal Judgment that will be executed 
on the Watchers and the Great Eternal 
Heaven that will spring from the midst 
of the Angels. 

91.16 And the First Heaven will vanish 
and pass away and a New Heaven will 
appear, and all the Powers of Heaven 
will shine forever, with sevenfold light.

91.17 And after this, there will be many 
weeks without number, forever, in 
goodness and in righteousness. And 
from then on sin will never again be 
mentioned. 

91.18 And now I tell you, my children, 
and show you the paths of 
righteousness, and the paths of 
wrongdoing. And I will show you again 
so that you may know what is to come. 

91.19 And now listen, my children, 
walk in the paths of righteousness and 
do not walk in the paths of wrongdoing, 
for all those who walk in the path of 
iniquity will be destroyed forever.

justice and righteousness still lasted. 

93.4 And, after me, in the second week, 
great injustice will arise, and deceit will 
have sprung up. And in it there will be 
the First End, and in it, a man will be 
saved. And after it has ended, iniquity 
will grow, and He will make a law for 
the sinners. 

93.5 And after this in the third week, at 
its end, a man will be chosen as the 
Plant of Righteous Judgment, and after 
him will come the Plant of 
Righteousness, forever. 

93.6 And after this, in the fourth week, 
at its end, visions of the righteous and 
Holy will be seen, and a Law for All 
Generations, and an enclosure will be 
made for them. 

93.7 And after this, in the fifth week, at 
its end, a House of Glory and 
Sovereignty will be built forever. 

93.8 And after this, in the sixth week, 
all those who live in it will be blinded. 
And the hearts of them all, lacking 
wisdom, will sink into impiety. And in 
it, a man will ascend, and at its end the 
House of Sovereignty will be burnt with 
fire. And in it the whole race of the 
chosen root will be scattered. 

93.9 And after this, in the seventh 
week, an apostate generation will arise. 
And many will be its deeds - but all its 
deeds will be apostasy. 

93.10 And at its end, the Chosen 
Righteous, from the Eternal Plant of 
Righteousness, will be chosen, to whom 
will be given sevenfold teaching,

things on the earth. 

98.2 For you men will put on yourselves 
more adornments than a woman, and 
more coloured garments than a girl, 
clothed in sovereignty, and in majesty, 
and in power, and silver, and gold, and 
purple, and honours, - and food will be 
poured out like water. 

98.3 Because of this they will have 
neither knowledge nor wisdom. And 
through this, they will be destroyed, 
together with their possessions, and 
with all their glory and their honour. 
And in shame, and in slaughter, and in 
great destitution, their spirits will be 
thrown into the fiery furnace. 

98.4 I swear to you, you sinners, that as 
a mountain has not, and will not, 
become a slave, nor a hill a woman's 
maid, so sin was not sent on the Earth 
but man, of himself, created it. And 
those who commit it will be subject to a 
great curse. 

98.5 And barrenness has not been given 
to a woman but because of the deeds of 
her hand she dies without children. 

98.6 I swear to you, you sinners, by the 
Holy and Great One, that all your evil 
deeds are revealed in Heaven and that 
your wrongdoing is not covered or 
hidden. 

98.7 And do not think in your spirit nor 
say in your heart, that you do not know, 
or do not see, every sin is written down 
every day in Heaven in front of the 
Most High. 

98.8 From now on, you know that all 
your wrongdoing that you do will be 
written down every day, until the day of 
your judgment. 

98.9 Woe to you, you fools, for you will 
be destroyed through your folly. And 
you do not listen to the wise and good 
will not come upon you. 

98.10 And now know that you are ready 
for the day of destruction. And do not 
hope that you will live, you sinners; 
rather you will go and die, for you know 
no ransom. You are ready for the Day 
of the Great Judgment and for the day 



of distress and great shame for your 
spirits. 

98.11 Woe to you, you stubborn of 
heart who do evil and eat blood, from 
where do you have good things to eat 
and drink and to be satisfied? From all 
the good things which our Lord the 
Most High has placed in abundance on 
the earth. Therefore you will not have 
peace. 

98.12 Woe to you who love deeds of 
iniquity. Why do you hope for good for 
yourselves? Know that you will be 
given into the hands of the righteous, 
and they will cut your throats and kill 
you, and will not have mercy on you. 

98.13 Woe to you who rejoice in the 
distress of the righteous for graves will 
not be dug for you. 

98.14 Woe to you who declare the 
words of the righteous empty for you 
will have no hope of life. 

98.15 Woe to you who write lying 
words, and the words of the impious, 
for they write their lies so that men may 
hear and continue their folly. And they 
will not have peace but will die a 
sudden death.

and cast out their children. And their 
offspring will slip from them, and they 
will cast out their children while they 
are still sucklings, and will not return to 
them, and will not have mercy on their 
beloved ones. 

99.6 And again I swear to you, the 
sinners, that sin is ready for the Day of 
Unceasing Bloodshed. 

99.7 And they worship stone, and some 
carve images of gold and of silver, and 
of wood and of clay. And some, with 
no knowledge, worship unclean spirits 
and demons, and every kind of error. 
But no help will be obtained from them. 

99.8 And they will sink into impiety 
because of the folly of their hearts, and 
their eyes will be blinded through the 
fear of their hearts, and through the 
vision of their ambitions. 

99.9 Through these they will become 
impious and fearful, for they do all their 
deeds with lies, and worship stones, and 
they will be destroyed at the same 
moment. 

99.10 And in those days, blessed are 
those who accept the words of wisdom, 
and understand them, and follow the 
paths of the Most High, and walk in the 
path of righteousness, and do not act 
impiously with the impious, for they 
will be saved. 

99.11 Woe to you who extend evil to 
your neighbours; for you will be killed 
in Sheol. 

99.12 Woe to you who lay foundations 
of sin and deceit, and who cause 
bitterness on the Earth, for because of 
this an end will be made of them. 

99.13 Woe to you who build your 
houses with the toil of others, and all 
their building materials are the sticks 
and stones of sin; I say to you: "You 
will not have peace." 

99.14 Woe to those who reject the 
measure, and the eternal inheritance of 
their fathers, and cause their souls to 
follow error, for they will not have rest. 

99.15 Woe to those who commit 
iniquity, and help wrong, and kill their 



neighbours, until the Day of the Great 
Judgment; for he will throw down your 
glory. 

99.16 And you put evil into your hearts, 
and rouse the spirit of his anger, so that 
he may destroy you all with the sword. 
And all the righteous and the Holy will 
remember your sin.

1 And after th o se d a v s m v son 



M e th u se lah chose a wife for his son 
L a m e c h and she became pregnant by 
him an d b re a so n . 

10 6.2 And his body was white like 
snow, and red like th e flower of a rose, 
and th e hair of his head was white like 
wool. And his eyes were b e a u tifu I and 
when he opened his eyes he made th e 
w h le h u se b rig h t. Ilk e th e S u n , so th a t 
th e w h le house was ex cep tio n ally 
brigh t. 
10 6.3 And when he was taken fro m th e 



56 



hand of the midwife he opened his 
mouth and spoke to the Lord of 
Righteousness. 

106.4 And his father Lamech was afraid 
of him, and fled, and went to his father 
Methuselah. 

106.5 And he said to him: "I have 
begotten a strange son; he is not like a 
man but is like the children of the 
Angels of Heaven, of a different type 
and not like us. And his eyes are like 
the rays of the Sun and his face 
glorious. 

106.6 And it seems to me that he is not 
sprung from me but from the Angels 
and I am afraid that something 
extraordinary may be done on the earth 
in his days. 

106.7 And now, my father, I am 
entreating you and petitioning you, to 
go to our father Enoch, and learn from 
him the truth, for his dwelling is with 
the Angels." 

106.8 And when Methuselah heard the 
words of his son he came to me, at the 
ends of the Earth, for he had heard that I 
was there. And he cried out, and I heard 
his voice and went to him. And I said 
to him: "Behold I am here my son, for 
you have come to me." 

106.9 And he answered me, and said: 
"Because of a great matter I have come 
to you, and because of a disturbing 
vision, have I come near. 

106.10 And now hear me, my father, for 
a child has been born to my son 
Lamech, whose form and type are not 
like the type of a man. His colour is 
whiter than snow, and redder than the 
flower of the rose, and the hair of his 
head is whiter than white wool. And his 
eyes are like the rays of the Sun; and he 
opened his eyes and made the whole 
house bright. 

106.11 And he was taken from the hand 
of the midwife, and he opened his 
mouth, and blessed the Lord of Heaven. 

106.12 And his father Lamech was 
afraid and fled to me. And he does not 
believe he is sprung from him but thinks 



him to be from the Angels of Heaven. 
And behold, I have come to you, so that 
you may make known to me the truth." 

106.13 And I, Enoch, answered and said 
to him: "The Lord will do new things 
on Earth, and this I have already seen in 
a vision, and made known to you. For 
in the generation of my father, Jared, 
some from the height of Heaven 
transgressed the word of the Lord. 

106.14 And behold, they commit sin 
and transgress the law, and have been 
promiscuous with women, and commit 
sin with them, and have married some 
of them, and have begotten children by 
them. 

106.15 And there will be great 
destruction over the whole Earth, and 
there will be a deluge, and there will be 
great destruction for one year. 

106.16 But this child, who has been 
born to you, will be left on the Earth, 
and his three sons will be saved with 
him. When all the men who are on the 
Earth die he and his sons will be saved. 

106.17 They will beget on the Earth 
giants, not of spirit, but of flesh, and 
there will be great wrath on Earth, and 
the Earth will be cleansed of all 
corruption. 

106.18 And now make known to your 
son Lamech that the one who has been 
bom is truly his son. And call his name 
Noah, for he will be a remnant for you 
and he and his sons will be saved from 
the destruction which is coming on the 
earth because of all the sin and all the 
iniquity, which will be committed on 
the Earth in his days. 

106.19 But after this, there will be yet 
greater iniquity than that which was 
committed on the earth before. For I 
know the mysteries of the Holy Ones, 
for the Lord showed them to me and 
made them known to me, and I read 
them in the Tablets of Heaven.

righteousness shall arise, and 
wrongdoing shall be destroyed, and sin 
shall depart from the earth, and 
everything good shall come upon it. 

107.2 And now, my son, go, make 
known to your son Lamech, that this 
child that has been bom, is truly his son, 
and this is no lie. 

107.3 And when Methuselah had heard 
the words of his father Enoch - for he 
showed him everything which is secret - 
he returned, having seen him, and called 
the name of that child Noah; for he will 
comfort the Earth after all the 
destruction. 



108 



A n til er book w li icli E n o cli 



wrote for his son Methuselah and for 
those who should come after him and 
keep the law in the last days. 

108.2 You who have observed, and are 
waiting in these days, until an end shall 
be made of those who do evil, and an 
end shall be made of the power of the 
wrongdoers. 

108.3 Do indeed wait until sin shall pass 
away, for their names shall be erased 
from the Books of the Holy Ones, and 
their offspring will be destroyed 
forever. And their spirits will be killed, 
and they will cry out and moan in a 
chaotic desert place, and will burn in 
fire, for there is no Earth there. 

108.4 And there I saw something like a 
cloud, which could not be discerned, for 
because of its depth I was not able to 
look into it. And the flames of a fire I 
saw, burning brightly, and things like 
bright mountains revolved and shook 
from side to side. 

108.5 And I asked one of the Holy 
Angels, who were with me, and I said to 
him: "What is this bright place? For 
there is no sky, but only the flames of a 
burning fire, and the sounds of crying, 
and weeping, and moaning, and severe 
pain." 

108.6 And he said to me: "This place 
which you see; here will be thrown the 



spirits of the sinners, and of the 
blasphemers, and of those who do evil. 
And of those who alter everything that 
the Lord has spoken through the mouths 
of the prophets about the things that 
shall be done. 

108.7 For there are books, and records, 
about them in Heaven above so that the 
Angels may read them and know what 
is about to come upon the sinners. And 
upon the spirits of the humble, and of 
those who afflicted their bodies and 
were recompensed by God, and of those 
who were abused by evil men. 

108.8 Those who loved God and did not 
love gold, or silver, or any possessions, 
but gave up their bodies to torment. 

108.9 Those who, from the moment 
they existed, did not desire earthly food, 
but counted themselves as a breath 
which passes away, and kept to this. 
And the Lord tested them much, and 
their spirits were found pure, so that 
they might bless His Name." 

108.10 And all their blessings I have 
recounted in the books, and he has 
assigned them their reward, for they 
were found to be such that they loved 
Heaven more than their life in the 
world. And although they were 
trampled underfoot by evil men, and 
had to listen to reviling and reproach 
from them, and were abused, yet they 
blessed their Lord. 

108.11 And the Lord said: "And now I 
will call the spirits of the good, who are 
of the Generation of Light, and I will 
transform those who were bom in 
darkness, who in the flesh were not 
recompensed with honour as was fitting 
to their faith. 

108.12 And I will bring out into the 
shining light those who love my Holy 
Name and I will set each one on the 
throne of his honour." 

108.13 And they will shine for times 
without number, for righteous is the 
Judgment of God, for with the faithful 
He will keep faith in the dwelling of 
upright paths.

108.14 And they will see those who 
were bom in darkness thrown into the 
darkness while the righteous shine. 

108.15 And the sinners will cry out as 
they see them shining but they 
themselves will go where days and 
times have been written down for them.

The Book of the Secrets of Enoch 

INTRODUCTION 

The Second Book of Enoch (usually abbreviated 2 Enoch, and otherwise variously known as 
Slavonic Enoch or The Secrets of Enoch) is a pseudepigraphic (a text whose claimed authorship 
is unfounded) of the Old Testament. It is usually considered to be part of the Apocalyptic 
literature. Late 1st century CE is the dating often preferred. The text has been preserved in full 
only in Slavonic, but in 2009 it was announced that Coptic fragments of the book had been 
identified. Greek is indicated as the language behind the Slavonic version[l]. It is not regarded as 
scripture by Jews or any Christian group. It was rediscovered and published at the end of 19th 
century. 

Most scholars consider 2 Enoch to be composed by an unknown Jewish sectarian group, while 
some authors think it is a 1st century Christian text[2][3]. A very few scholars consider it a later 
Christian work[4]. This article discusses 2 Enoch. It is distinct from the Book of Enoch, known 
as 1 Enoch. There is also an unrelated 3 Enoch. The numbering of these texts has been applied 
by scholars to distinguish the texts from one another. 

Dates ranging from the 1st century BC to the 10th century CE have been proposed, with the late 
1st century CE often preferred. The date of the text can be deduced solely on the basis of the 
internal evidence since the book has survived only in the medieval manuscripts (even if a 
reference of 2 Enoch could be find in Origen's De Principis i, 3:3). Composition shall be later 
than the Book of the Watchers in 1 Enoch (about III century BCE). The crucial arguments for the 
early dating of the text have very largely been linked to the themes of the Temple in Jerusalem 
and its ongoing practices and customs. Scholarly efforts have been in this respect mostly directed 
toward finding hints that the Sanctuary was still standing when the original text was composed. 
Scholars noted that the text gives no indication that the destruction of the Temple had already 
occurred at the time of the book's composition. Critical readers of the pseudepigraphic would 
have some difficulties finding any explicit expression of feelings of sadness or mourning about 
the loss of the sanctuary. 

Affirmations of the value of animal sacrifice and Enoch's halakhic instructions found in 2 Enoch 
59 also appear to be fashioned not in the "preservationist," mishnaic-like mode but rather as if 
they reflected sacrificial practices that still existed when the author was writing his book. The 
author tries legitimize the central place of worship, which through the reference to the place 
Ahuzan, which is a cryptic name for a Jewish Temple. 

Scholars have also previously noted in the text some indications of the ongoing practice of 
pilgrimage to the central place of worship. These indications could be expected in a text written 
in the Alexandrian Diaspora. Thus in his instructions to the children, Enoch repeatedly 
encourages them to bring the gifts before the face of God for the remission of sins, a practice 
which appears to recall well-known sacrificial customs widespread in the Second Temple period. 
Further, the Slavonic apocalypse also contains a direct command to visit the Temple three times 
a day, an inconsistency if the sanctuary had been already destroyed.

. 1 Those men took me, and led me up 

on to the fourth heaven, and showed me all 
the successive goings, and all the rays of the 
light of sun and moon. 

2 And I measure their goings, and compared 
their light, and saw that the sun's light is 
greater than the moon's. 

3 Its circle and the wheels on which it goes 
always, hke the wind going past with very 
marvellous speed, and day and night it has 
no rest. 

4 Its passage and return (are accompanied 
by) four great stars, (and) each star has 
under it a thousand stars, to the right of the 
sun's wheel, (and by) four to the left, each 
having under it a thousand stars, altogether 
eight thousand, issuing with the sun 
continually. 

5 And by day fifteen myriads of angels 
attend it, and by night A thousand. 

6 And six- winged ones issue with the angels 
before the sun's wheel into the fiery flames, 
and a hundred angels kindle the sun and set 
it alight.

elements of th e sun, whose names (are ) 
Phoenixes and C h a I k y d r i , marvellous and

Adam, and showed him the two ways, the

14 This is good, and that bad, that I should 
learn whether he has love towards me, or 
hatred, that it be clear which in his race love 
me. 

15 For I have seen his nature, but he has not 
seen his own nature, therefore (through) not 
seeing he will sin worse, and I said After sin 
(what is there) but death? 

16 And I put sleep into him and he fell 
asleep. And I took from him A rib, and 
created him a wife, that death should come

Eva (Eve).

seven) revolve in the form of the seventh 
thousand, and that at the beginning of the 
eighth thousand there should be a time of 
not-counting, endless, with neither years nor 
months nor weeks nor days nor hours. 

2 And now, Enoch, all that I have told you, 
all that you have understood, all that you 
have seen of heavenly things, all that you 
have seen on earth, and all that I have 
written in books by my great wisdom, all 
these things I have devised and created from 
the uppermost foundation to the lower and 
to the end, and there is no counsellor nor 
inheritor to my creations. 

3 I am self-eternal, not made with hands, 
and without change. 

4 My thought is my counsellor, my wisdom 
and my word are made, and my eyes 
observe all things how they stand here and 
tremble with terror.

5 If I turn away my face, then all things will 
be destroyed. 

6 And apply your mind, Enoch, and know 
him who is speaking to you, and take thence 
the books which you yourself have written. 

7 And I give you Samuil and Raguil, who 
led you up, and the books, and go down to 
earth, and tell your sons all that I have told 
you, and all that you have seen, from the 
lower heaven up to my throne, and all the 
troops. 

8 For I created all forces, and there is none 
that resists me or that does not subject 
himself to me. For all subject themselves to 
my monarchy, and labour for my sole rule. 

9 Give them the books of the handwriting, 
and they will read (them) and will know me 
for the creator of all things, and will 
understand how there is no other God but 
me. 

10 And let them distribute the books of your 
handwriting-children to children, generation 
to generation, nations to nations. 

11 And I will give you, Enoch, my 
intercessor, the archistratege Michael, for 
the handwritings of your fathers Adam, 
Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahaleleel, and Tared 
your father.

then in the other the weights and let them

make the earth to rock. 

9 And I measured out the whole earth, its 
mountains, and all hills, fields, trees, stones, 
rivers, all existing things I wrote down, the

downwards to the very lowest hell, and the 
judgment-place, and the very great, open

■.1 The Lord with his hands having 

created man, in the likeness of his own face, 
the Lord made him small and great. 

2 Whoever reviles the ruler's face, and 
abhors the Lord's face, has despised the 
Lord's face, and he who vents anger on any 
man without injury, the Lord's great anger 
will cut him down, he who spits on the face 
of man reproachfully, will be cut down at 
the Lord's great judgment. 

3 Blessed is the man who does not direct his 
heart with malice against any man, and helps 
the injured and condemned, and raises the 
broken down, and shall do charity to the 
needy, because on the day of the great 
judgment every weight, every measure and 
every makeweight (will be) as in the market, 
that is to say (they are) hung on scales and 
stand in the market, (and every one) shall 
learn his own measure, and according to his

INTRODUCTION 
ENOCH 3 

3 Enoch is an Old Testament Apocryphal book. 3 Enoch purports to have been written in the 
second century CE, but its origins can only be traced to the fifth century. [1] Other names for 3 
Enoch include "The Third Book of Enoch", "The Book of the Palaces", "The Book of Rabbi 
Ishmael the High Priest" and "The Revelation of Metatron". 

Content 

Modern scholars describe this book as pseudepigraphal, as it says it is written by Rabbi Ishmael 
who became a 'high priest' after visions of ascension to Heaven, 90 AD - 135 AD.[1] Rabbi 
Ishmael is a leading figure of Merkabah literature. 

The name Sefer Hekhalot (Hekhalot meaning Palaces/Temples), along with its proposed author, 
places this book as a member of Hekalot/Merkabah lore. Its contents suggest that 3 Enoch's 
contents and ideas are newer than those shown in other Merkabah texts. [4] The book does not 
contain Merkabah hymns, [5] it has unique layout[6] and adjuration. [7] All these facts make 3 
Enoch unique not just among Merkabah writings, but also within the writings of Enoch. 

3 Enoch contains a number of Greek and Latin words. This book, unlike 1 Enoch, appears to 
have been originally written in Hebrew. There are a number of indications suggesting that the 
writers of 3 Enoch had knowledge of, and most likely read, 1 Enoch. 

Some points that appear in Enoch 1 and Enoch 3 are: 

Enoch ascends to Heaven in a storm chariot (3 Enoch 6:1; 7:1) 

Enoch is transformed into an angel (3 Enoch 9:1-5; 15:1-2) 

Enoch as an exalted angel is enthroned in Heaven (3 Enoch 10:1-3; 16:1) 

Enoch receives a revelation of cosmological secrets of creation (3 Enoch 13:1-2) 

The story about precious metals and how they will not avail their users and those that make idols 

from them (3 Enoch 5:7-14) 

One of the characters is a hostile angel named Azaz'el/Aza'el (3 Enoch 4:6; 5:9) 

The main themes running through 3 Enoch are the ascension of Enoch into Heaven and his 
transformation into the angel Metatron. 



ENOCH 3 

THE BOOK OF ENOCH 

BY R. ISHMAEL BEN ELISHA 
THE HIGH PRIEST 



EDITED AND TRANSLATED BY 

HUGO ODEBERG 



CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTION : 

R. Ishmael ascends to heaven to 

behold the vision of the Merkaba 

and 

is given in charge to Metatron 

AND ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD : 
AND HE WAS NOT ; FOR GOD TOOK 

HIM (Gen. v. 24) 

Rabbi Ishmael said : 

(1) When I ascended on high to behold the 
vision of the Merkaba and had entered the 
six Halls, one within the other: 

(2) as soon as I reached the door of the 
seventh Hall I stood still in prayer before the 
Holy One, blessed be He, and, lifting up my 
eyes on high (i.e. towards the Divine 
Majesty), I said : 

(3) " Lord of the Universe, I pray thee, that 
the merit of Aaron, the son of Amram, the 
lover of peace 

and pursuer of peace, who received the 
crown of priesthood from Thy Glory on the 
mount of Sinai, be valid for me in this hour, 
so that Qafsiel*, the prince, and the angels 
with him may not get power over me nor 
throw me down from the heavens ". 

(4) Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, 
sent to me Metatron, his Servant ('Ebed) the 
angel, the Prince of the Presence, and he, 
spreading his wings, with great joy came to 
meet me so as to save me from their hand. 



(5) And he took me by his hand in their 
sight, saying to me: "Enter in peace before 
the high and exalted King3 and behold the 
picture of the Merkaba". 

(6) Then I entered the seventh Hall, and he 
led me to the camp(s) of Shekina and placed 
me before 6the Holy One, blessed be He, to 
behold the Merkaba. 

(7) As soon as the princes of the Merkaba 
and the flaming Seraphim perceived me, 
they fixed their eyes upon me. Instantly 
trembling and shuddering seized me and I 
fell down and was benumbed by the radiant 
image of their eyes and the splendid 
appearance of their faces; until the Holy 
One, blessed be He, rebuked them, saying: 

(8) "My servants, my Seraphim, my 
Kerubim and my 'Ophanniml Cover ye your 
eyes before Ishmael, my son, my friend, my 
beloved one and my glory, that he tremble 
not nor shudder !" 

(9) Forthwith Metatron the Prince of the 
Presence, came and restored my spiritand 
put me upon my feet. 

(10) After that (moment) there was no tin me 
strength enough to say a song before the 
Throne of Glory of the glorious King, the 
mightiest of all kings, the most excellent of 
all princes, until after the hour had passed. 

(11) After one hour (had passed) the Holy 
One, blessed be He, opened to me the gates 
of Shekina, the gates of Peace, the gates of 
Wisdom, the gates of Strength, the gates of 
Power, the gates of Speech (Dibbur), the 
gates of Song, the gates of Qedushsha, the 
gates of Chant. 



82 



(12) And he enlightened my eyes and my 
heart by words of psalm, song, praise, 
exaltation, thanksgiving, extolment, 
glorification, hymn and eulogy. And as I 
opened my mouth, uttering a song before the 
Holy One, blessed be He, the Holy 
Chayyoth beneath and above the Throne of 
Glory answered and said : "HOLY " and 
"BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF YHWH 
FROM HIS PLACE!" 
(i.e. chanted the Qedushsha). 



CHAPTER II 

The highest classes of angels make 

inquiries about R. Ishmael which 

are answered by Metatron 

R. Ishmael said: 

(1) In that hour the eagles of the Merkaba, 
the flaming 'Ophannim and the Seraphim of 
consuming fire asked Metatron, saying to 
him: 

(2) "Youth ! Why sufferest thou one born of 
woman to enter and behold the Merkaba? 
From which nation, from which tribe is this 
one? What is his character?" 

(3) Metatron answered and said to them : 
"From the nation of Israel whom the Holy 
One, blessed be He, chose for his people 
from among seventy tongues (nations), from 
the tribe of Levi, whom he set aside as a 
contribution to his name and from the seed 
of Aaron whom the Holy One, blessed be 
He, did choose for his servant and put upon 
him the crown of priesthood on Sinai". 

(4) Forthwith they spake and said : "Indeed, 
this one is worthy to behold the Merkaba ". 
And they said: "Happy is the people that is 
in such a case!". 



CHAPTER III 

Metatron has 70 names, but God 

calls him 'Youth' 

R. Ishmael said: 

(1) In that hourl I asked Metatron, the angel, 
the Prince of the Presence: "What is thy 
name?" 



(2) He answered me: "I have seventy names, 
corresponding to the seventy tongues of the 
world and all of them are based upon the 
name Metatron, angel of the Presence; but 
my King calls me 'Youth' (Na'ar)" 



CHAPTER IV 

Metatron is identical with Enoch 

who was translated to heaven at the 

time of the Deluge 

R. Ishmael said : 

(1) I asked Metatron and said to him: "Why 
art thou called by the name of thy Creator, 
by seventy names? Thou art greater than all 
the princes, higher than all the angels, 
beloved more than all the 

servants, honoured above all the mighty 
ones in kingship, greatness and glory : why 
do they call thee ' Youth ' in the high 
heavens ?" 

(2) He answered and said to me: " Because I 
am Enoch, the son of Tared. 

(3) For when the generation of the flood 
sinned and were confounded in their deeds, 
saying unto God: 'Depart from us, for we 
desire not the knowledge of thy ways' (Job 
xxi. 14), then the Holy One, blessed be He, 
removed me from their midst to be a witness 
against them in the high heavens to all the 
inhabitants of the world, that they may not 
say: 'The Merciful One is cruel". 

(4) What sinned all those multitudes, their 
wives, their sons and their, daughters, their 
horses, their mules and their cattle and their 
property, and all the birds of the world, all 
of which the Holy One, blessed be He, 
destroyed from the world together with them 
in the waters of the flood? 

(5) Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, 
lifted me up in their lifetime before their 
eyes to be a witness against them to the 
future world. And the Holy One, blessed be 
He, assigned me for a prince 
and a ruler among the ministering angels. 
(6) In that hour three of the ministering 
angels, 'UZZA, 'AZZA and 'AZZAEL came 
forth and brought charges against me in the 
high heavens, saying before the Holy One, 
blessed be He: 



83 



"Said not the Ancient Ones (First Ones) 
rightly before Thee: &lt; Do not create 
man! ' " The Holy One, blessed be He, 
answered and said unto them: "I have made 
and I will bear, yea, I will carry and will 
deliver". (Is. xlvi. 4.) 

(7) As soon as they saw me, they said before 
Him: "Lord of the Universe ! What is this 
one that he should ascend to the height of 
heights? Is not he one from among the sons 
of [the sons of] those 

who perished in the days of the Flood? 
"What doeth he in the Raqia'?" 

(8) Again, the Holy One, blessed be He, 
answered and said to them: "What are ye, 
that ye enter and speak in my presence? I 
delight in this one more than in all of you, 
and hence he shall be a prince and a ruler 
over you in the high heavens." 

(9) Forthwith all stood up and went out to 
meet me, prostrated themselves before me 
and said: "Happy art thou and happy is thy 
father for thy Creator doth favour thee". 

(10) And because I am small and a youth 
among them in days, months and years, 
therefore they call me "Youth" (Na'ar). 



CHAPTER V 

The idolatry of the generation of 

Enosh causes God to remove the 

Shekina from earth. The idolatry 

inspired by 'Azza, 'Uzza and 'Azziel 

R.Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of 
the Presence, said to me: 

(1) From the day when the Holy One, 
blessed be He, expelled the first Adam from 
the Garden of Eden (and onwards), Shekina 
was dwelling upon a Kerub under the Tree 
of Life. 

(2) And the ministering angels were 
gathering together and going down from 
heaven in parties, from the Raqia in 
companies and from the heavens in camps to 
do His will in the whole world. 

(3) And the first man and his generation 
were sitting outside the gate of the Garden to 
behold the radiant appearance of the 
Shekina. 



(4) For the silendour of the Shekina 
traversed the world from one end to the 
other (with a splendour) 365,000 times (that) 
of the globe of the sun. And everyone who 
made use of the splendour of the Shekina, 
on him no flies and no gnats did rest, neither 
was he ill nor suffered he any pain. No 
demons got power over him, neither were 
they able to injure him. 

(5) When the Holy One, blessed be He, went 
out and went in: from the Garden to Eden, 
from Eden to the Garden, from the Garden 
to Raqia and from Raqia to the Garden of 
Eden then all and everyone beheld the 
splendour of His Shekina and they were not 
injured; 

(6) until uthe time of the generation of 
Enosh who was the head of all idol 
worshippers of the world. (7) And what did 
the generation of Enosh do? They went from 
one end of the world to the other, and each 
one brought silver, gold, precious stones and 
pearls in heaps like unto mountains and hills 
making idols out of them throughout all the 
world. And they erected the idols in every 
quarter of the world: the size of each idol 
was 1000 parasangs. 

(8) And they brought down the sun, the 
moon, planets and constellations, and placed 
them before the idols on their right hand and 
on their left, to attend them even as they 
attend the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is 
written (1 Kings xxii. 19): "And all the host 
of heaven was standing by him on his right 
hand and on his left". 

(9) What power was in them that they were 
able to bring them down? They would not 
have been able to bring them down but for 
'Uzza, 'Azza and 'Azziel who taught them 
sorceries whereby they brought them down 
and made use of them 

(10) In that time the ministering angels 
brought charges (against them) before the 
Holy One, blessed be He, saying before him: 
"Master of the Worid! What hast thou to do 
with the children of men? As it is written 
(Ps. viii. 4) 'What is man (Enosh) that thou 
art mindful of him?' 'Mah Adam' is not 
written here, but 'Mah Enosh', for he 
(Enosh) is the head of the idol worshippers. 

(11) Why hast thou left the highest of the 
high heavens, the abode of thy glorious 



84 



Name, and the high and exalted Throne in 
'Araboth Raqia' in the highest and art gone 
and dwellest with the children of men who 
worship idols and equal thee to the idols. 
(12)Now thou art on earth and the idols 
likewise. What hast thou to do with the 
inhabitants of the earth who worship idols?" 
(13) Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, 
lifted up His Shekina from the earth, from 
their midst. (14) In that moment came the 
ministering angels, the troops of hosts and 
the armies of 'Araboth in thousand camps 
and ten thousand hosts : they fetched 
trumpets and took the horns in their hands 
and surrounded the Shekina with all kinds of 
songs.And He ascended to the high heavens, 
as it is written (Ps. xlvii. 5): "God is gone up 
with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a 
trumpet ". 



CHAPTER VI 
Enoch lifted up to heaven together 

with the Shekina. 
Angels protests answered by God 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) When the Holy One, blessed be He, 
desired to lift me up on high. He first sent 
'Anaphiel H (H = Tetragrammaton) the 
Prince, and he took me from their midst in 
their sight and carried me in great glory 
upon a a fiery chariot with fiery horses, 
servants of glory. And he lifted me up to the 
high heavens together with the Shekina. 

(2) As soon as I reached the high heavens, 
the Holy Chayyoth, the 'Ophannim, the 
Seraphim, the Kerubim, the Wheels of the 
Merkaba (the Galgallim), and the ministers 
of the consuming fire, perceiving my smell 
from a distance of 365,ooo myriads of 
parasangs, said: "What smell of one born of 
woman and what taste of a white drop (is 
this) that ascends on high, and (lo, he is 
merely) a gnat among those who 'divide 
flames (of fire)'?" 

(3) The Holy One, blessed be He, answered 
and spake unto them: "My servants, my 
hosts, my Kerubim, my 'Ophannim, my 



Seraphim! Be ye not displeased on account 
of this! Since all the children of men have 
denied me and my great Kingdom and are 
gone worshipping idols, I have removed my 
Shekina from among them and have lifted it 
up on high. But this one whom I have taken 
from among them is an ELECT ONE among 
(the inhabitants of) the world and he is equal 
to all of them in faith, righteousness and 
perfection of deed and I have taken him for 
(as) a tribute from my world under all the 
heavens". 



CHAPTER Vn 
Enoch raised upon the wings of the 
Shekina to the place of the Throne, 
the Merkaba and the angeUc hosts 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me: 

(1) When the Holy One, blessed be He, took 
me away from the generation of the Flood, 
he lifted me on the wings of the wind of 
Shekina to the highest heaven and brought 
me into the great palaces of the 'Araboth 
Raqia' on high, where are the glorious 
Throne of Shekina, the Merkaba, the troops 
of anger, the armies of vehemence, the fiery 
Shin'anim', the flaming Kerubim, and the 
burning 'Ophannim, the flaming servants, 
the flashing Chashmattim and the lightening 
Seraphim. And he placed me (there) to 
attend the Throne of Glory day after day. 

CHAPTER VIII 

The gates (of the treasuries of 
heaven) opened to Metatron 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the Prince of

He, opened to me

instruction, love unto love, loving-kindness 
unto loving-kindness, goodness unto 
goodness, meekness unto meekness, power

good and praiseworthy things more than all 
the children of heaven.

Most High and is adorned with

the Presence, said to me : 

(1) After all these things the Holy One, 
blessed be He, put His hand upon me and 
blessed me with 5360 blessings. 

(2) And I was raised and enlarged to the size 
of the length and width of the world. 

(3) And He caused 72 wings to grow on me, 
36 on each side. And each wing was as the 
whole world. 

(4) And He fixed on me 365 eyes : each eye 
was as the great luminary.

brilliance, radiance, beauty in (of) all the 
lights of the universe that He did not fix on 
me.

Metatron henceforth is God's 

representative and ruler over all the 

princes of kingdoms and all the 

children of heaven, save the eight 

high princes called YHWH by the 

name of their King 



R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the Prince of 
the Presence, said to me : 

(1) All these things the Holy One, blessed be 
He, made for me:He made me a Throne, 
similar to the Throne of Glory. And He 
spread over me a curtain of splendour and 
brilliant appearance, of beauty, grace and 
mercy, similar to the curtain of the Throne 
of Glory; and on it were fixed all kinds of 
lights in the universe. 

(2) And He placed it at the door of the 
Seventh Hall and seated me on it. 

(3) And the herald went forth into every 
heaven, saying:This is Metatron, my servant. 
I have made him into a prince and a ruler 
over all the princes of my kingdoms and 
over all the children of heaven, except the 
eight great princes, the honoured and 
revered ones who are called YHWH, by the 
name of their King. 

(4) And every angel and every prince who 
has a word to speak in my presence (before 
me) shall go into his presence (before him) 
and shall speak to him (instead). 

(5) And every command that he utters to you 
in my name do ye observe and fulfil. For the 
Prince of 

Wisdom and the Prince of Understanding 
have I committed to him to instruct him in 
the wisdom of heavenly things and of 
earthly things, in the wisdom of this world 
and of the world to come. 
(6) Moreover, I have set him over all the 
treasuries of the palapes of Araboih and over 
all the stores of life that I have in the high 
heavens.

secrets to Metatron 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me: 

(1) Henceforth the Holy One, blessed be He, 
revealed to me all the mysteries of Tora and 
all the secrets of wisdom and all the depths 
of the Perfect Law; and all living beings' 
thoughts of heart and all the secrets of the 
universe and all the secrets of Creation were 
revealed unto me even as they are revealed 
unto the Maker of Creation. 

(2) And I watched intently to behold the 
secrets of the depth and the wonderful 
mystery. Before a man did think in secret, I 
saw (it) and before a man made a thing I 
beheld it. 

(3) And there was no thing on high nor in 
the deep hidden from me. 



CHAPTER XII 

God clothes Metatron in a garment 

of glory, puts a royal 

crown on his head and calls him 

"the Lesser YHWH" 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of 
the Presence, said to me: 

(1) By reason of the love with which the 
Holy One, blessed be He, loved me more 
than all the children of heaven. He made me 
a garment of glory on which were fixed all 
kinds of lights, and He clad me in it. 
(2)And He made me a robe of honour on 
which were fixed all kinds of beauty, 
splendour, brilliance and majesty. 

(3) And he made me a royal crown in which 
were fixed forty-nine costly stones like unto 
the light of the globe of the sun. 

(4) For its splendour went forth in the four 
quarters of the Araboth Raqia', and in 
(through) the seven heavens, and in the four 
quarters of the world. And he put it on my 
head. 

(5) And He called me THE LESSER 
YHWH in the presence of all His heavenly 
household; as it is written (Ex. xxiii. 21): 
"For my name is in him".

Metatron 's crown the 

cosmic letters by which heaven and 

earth were created 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, the Glory of all 
heavens, said to me : 

(1) Because of the great love and mercy with 
which the Holy One, blessed be He, loved 
and cherished me more than all the children 
of heaven. He wrote with his ringer with a 
flaming style upon the crown on my head 
the letters by which were created heaven and 
earth, the seas and rivers, the mountains and 
hills, the planets and constellations, the 
lightnings, winds, earthquakes and voices 
(thunders), the snow and hail, the storm- 
wind and the tempest ; the letters by which 
were created all the needs of the world and 
all the orders of Creation. 

(2) And every single letter sent forth time 
after time as it were lightnings, time after 
time as it were torches, time after time as it 
were flames of fire, time after time (rays) 
like [as] the rising of the sun and the moon 
and the planets. 

CHAPTER XIV 

All the highest princes, the 

elementary angels and the 

planetary and sideric angels fear 

and tremble at the sight of 

Metatron crowned 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) When the Holy One, blessed be He, put 
this crown on my head, (then) trembled 
before me all the Princes of Kingdoms who 
are in the height of Araboth Raqiaf and all 
the hosts of every heaven; and even the 
princes (of) the 'Elim, the princes (of) the 
'Er'ellim and the princes (of) the Tafsarim, 
who are greater than all the ministering 
angels who minister before the Throne of 



87 



Glory, shook, feared and trembled before me 
when they beheld me. 

(2) Even Sammael, the Prince of the 
Accusers, who is greater than all the princes 
of kingdoms on high; feared and trembled 
before me. 

(3) And even the angel of fire, and the angel 
of hail, and the angel of the wind, and the 
angel of the lightning, and the angel of 
anger, and the angel of the thunder, and the 
angel of the snow, and the angel of the rain 
; and the angel of the day, and the angel of 
the night, and the angel of the sun and the 
angel of the moon, and the angel of the 
planets and the angel of the constellations 
who rule the world under their hands, feared 
and trembled and were affrighted before me, 
when they beheld me. 

(4) These are the names of the rulers of the 
world: Gabriel, the angel of the fire, 
Baradiel, the angel of the hail, Ruchiel who 
is appointed over the wind, Baraqiel who is 
appointed over the lightnings, 

Za'amiel who is appointed over the

(5) And they all fell prostrate, when they 
saw me. And they were not able to behold 
me because of the majestic glory and beauty 
of the appearance of the shining light of the 
crown of glory upon my head. 



CHAPTER XV 
Metatron transformed into fire 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the angel, the 



Prince of the Presence, the Glory of all 
heavens, said to me : 

(1) As soon as the Holy One, blessed be He, 
took me in (His) service to attend the Throne 
of Glory and the Wheels (Galgallim) of the 
Merkaba and the needs of Shekina, 
forthwith my flesh was changed into flames, 
my sinews into flaming fire, my bones into 
coals of burning juniper, the light of my eye- 
lids into splendour of lightnings, my eye- 
balls into fire-brands, the hair of my head 
into dot flames, all my limbs into wings of 
burning fire and the whole of my body into 
glowing fire. 

(2) And on my right were divisions 6 of 
fiery flames, on my left fire-brands were 
burning, round about me stormwind and 
tempest were blowing and in front of me and 
behind me was roaring of thunder with 
earthquake. 

FRAGMENT OF 'ASCENSION OF 
MOSES' 

(1) R. Ishmael said: Said to me Metatron, 
the Prince of the Presence and the prince 
over all the princes and he stands befote 
Him who is greater than all the Elohim. And 
he goes in under the Throne of Glory. And 
he has a great tabernacle of light on high. 
And he brings forth the fire of deafness and 
puts (it) into the ears of the Holy Chayyoth, 
that they may not hear the voice of the Word 
(Dibbur) that goes forth from the mouth of 
the Divine Majesty. 

(2) And when Moses ascended on high, he 
fasted 121 fasts, till the habitations of the 
chashmal were opened to him; and he saw 
the heart within the heart of the Lion and he 
saw the innumerable companies of the hosts 
Around about him. And they desired to burn 
him. But Moses prayed for mercy, first for 
Israel and after that for himself: and He who 
sitteth on the Merkaba opened the windows 
that are above the heads of the Kerubim. 
And a host of 1800 advocates and the Prince 
of the Presence, Metatron, with them went 
forth to meet Moses. And they took the 
prayers of Israel and put them as a crown on 
the head of the Holy One, blessed be He. 

(3) And they said (Deut. vi. 4): "Hear, O 
Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord"and 
their face shone and rejoiced over 



Shekinaand they said to Metatron: "What 
are these? And to whom do they give all this 
honour and glory?" And they answered: "To 
the Glorious Lord of Israel". And they 
spake: "Hear, O Israel: the Lord, our God, is 
one Lord. To whom shall be given 
abundance of honour and majesty but to 
Thee YHWH, the Divine Majesty, the King, 
living and eternal". 

(4) In that moment spake Akatriel Yah 
Yehod Sebaoth and said to Metatron, the 
Prince of the Presence: "Let no prayer that 
he prayeth before me return (to him) void. 
Hear thou his prayer and fulfil his desire 
whether (it be) great or small". 

(5) Forthwith Metatron, the Prince of the 
Presence, said to Moses: 

"Son of Amram! Fear not, for now God 
delights in thee. And ask thou u thy desire of 
the Glory and Majesty. For thy face shines 
from one end of the world to the other". But 
Moses answered him: "(I fear) lest I bring 
guiltiness upon myself". Metatron said to 
him: "Receive the letters of the oath, in (by) 
which there is no breaking the covenant" 
(which precludes any breach of the 
covenant). 



kingdoms were standing before me, on my 
right and on my left by authority of the Holy 
One, blessed be He. 

(2) But when Acher came to behold the 
vision of the Merkaba and fixed his eyes on 
me, he feared and trembled before me and 
his soul was affrighted even unto departing 
from him, because of fear, horror and dread 
of me, when he beheld me sitting upon a 
throne like a king with all the ministering 
angels standing by me as my servants and all 
the princes of kingdoms adorned with 
crowns surrounding me: 

(3) in that moment he opened his mouth and 
said: "Indeed, there are two Divine Powers 
in heaven!" (4) Forthwith Bath Qol (the 
Divine Voice) went forth from heaven from 
before the Shekina and said: "Return, ye 
backsliding children (Jer. iii. 22), except 
Acher!" 

(5) Then came 'Aniyel, the Prince, the 
honoured, glorified, beloved, wonderful, 
revered and fearful one, in commission from 
the Holy One, blessed be He and gave me 
sixty strokes with lashes of fire and made 
me stand on my feet. 



CHAPTER XVI 1 

Probably additional 

Metatron divested of his privilege of 

presiding on a 

Throne of his own on account of 

Acher's misapprehension 

in taking him for a second Divine 

Power 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, the Glory of all 
heaven, said to me: 

(1) At first I was sitting upon a great Throne 
at the door of the Seventh Hall ; and I was 
judging the children of heaven, the 
household on high by authority of the Holy 
One, blessed be He. And I divided 
Greatness, Kingship, Dignity, Rulership, 
Honour and Praise, and Diadem and Crown 
of Glory unto all the princes of kingdoms, 
while I was presiding (lit. sitting) in the 
Celestial Court (Yeshiba), and the princes of 



CHAPTER XVII 
The princes of the seven heavens, of 

the sun, moon, 

planets and constellations and their 

suites of angels 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, the glory of all 
heavens, said to me: 

(1) Seven (are the) princes, the great, 
beautiful, revered, wonderful and honoured 
ones who are appointed over the seven 
heavens. And these are they : MIKAEL, 
GABRIEL, SHATQIEL, SHACHAQIEL, 
BAKARIEL, BAD ARIEL, PACHRIEL. 

(2) And every one of them is the prince of 
the host of (one) heaven. And each one of 
them is accompanied by 496,000 myriads of 
ministering angels. 

(3) MIKAEL, the great prince, is appointed 
over the seventh heaven, the highest one, 
which is in the 'Araboth. GABRIEL, the 



89 



prince of the host, is appointed over the 

sixth heaven which is in Makon. 

SHATAQIEL, prince of the host, is 

appointed over the fifth heaven which is in 

Ma'on. 

SHAHAQi'EL, prince of the host, is 

appointed over the fourth heaven which is in 

Zebul. 

BAD ARIEL, prince of the host, is appointed 

over the third heaven which is in Shehaqim.

over the second heaven which is in the 

height of (Merom) Raqia. 

PAZRIEL, prince of the host, is appointed 

over the first heaven which is in Wilon, 

which is in Shamayim. 

(4) Under them is GALGALLIEL, the 

prince who is appointed over the globe 

(galgal) of the sun, and with him are 96 

great and honoured angels who move the 

sun in Raqia'. 

(5)Under them is 'OPHANNIEL, the prince 

who is set over the globe ('ophari) of the 

moon. And with him are 88 angels who 

move the globe of the moon 354 thousand 

parasangs every night at the time when the 

moon stands in the East at its turning point. 

And when is the moon sitting in the East at 

its turning point? Answer: in the fifteenth 

day of every month. 

(6) Under them is RAHATIEL, the prince 
who is appointed over the constellations. 
And he is accompanied by 72 great and 
honoured angels. And why is he called 
RAHATIEL? Because he makes the stars 
run (marhit) in their orbits and courses 339 
thousand parasangs every 

night from the East to the West, and from 
the West to the East. For the Holy One, 
blessed be He, has made a tent for all of 
them, for the sun, the moon, the planets and 
the stars in which they travel at night from 
the West to the East. 

(7) Under them is KOKBIEL, the prince 
who is appointed over all the planets. And 
with him are 365,000 myriads of ministering 
angels, great and honoured ones who move 
the planets from city to city and from 
province to province in the Raqia' of 
heavens. 

(8) And over them are SEVENTY-TWO 
PRINCES OF KINGDOMS on high 



corresponding to the 72 tongues of the 
world. And all of them are crowned with 
royal crowns and clad in royal garments and 
wrapped in royal cloaks. And all of them are 
riding on royal horses and they are holding 
royal sceptres in their hands. And before 
each one of them when he is travelling in 
Raqia' , royal servants are running with great 
glory and majesty even as on earth they 
(princes) are travelling in chariot(s) with 
horsemen and great armies and in glory and 
greatness with praise, song and honour.

his honour and majesty and his crown and

Raqia on high even as the Maker of the 
World (doth overshadow them). Just as it is 
written with regard to the Maker of the

of 'Anaphiel cover all the glories of 'Araboth

a balance in the presence of the Holy One, 
blessed be He. 

(21) Andwhen he sees ZEHANPURYU 
H',the great prince, the mighty and terrible 
one, honoured, glorified and feared in all the

(22) Andwhen he sees 'AZBUGA H', the 
great prince, glorified, revered, honoured, 
adorned, wonderful, exalted, beloved and 
feared among allthe great princes who know 
the mystery of the Throne of Glory, he

and falls on his face. Why is he called 
'Azbuga? Because in the future he will gird 
(clothe) the righteous and pious of the world 
with the garments of life and wrap them in 
the cloak of life, that they may live in them 
an eternal life. 

(23) And when he sees the two great 
princes, the strong and glorified ones who 
are standing above him, he removes the 
crown of glory from his head and falls on 
his face. And these are the names of the two 
princes: 

SOPHERIEL H' (WHO) KILLETH, 
(Sopheriel H' the Killer), the great prince, 
the honoured, glorified, blameless, 
venerable, ancient and mighty one; (and) 
SOPHERIEL H' (WHO) MAKETH ALIVE 
(Sopheriel H' the Lifegiver), the great 
prince, the honoured, glorified, blameless, 
ancient and mighty one. 

(24) Why is he called Sopheriel H' who 
killeth (Sopheriel H' the Killer)? Because he 
is appointed over the books of the dead : [so 
that] everyone, when the day of his death 
draws nigh, he writes him in the books of 
the dead. 

Why is he called Sopheriel H' who maketh 
alive (Sopheriel H' the Lifegiver)? Because 
he is appointed over the books of the living 
(of life), so that every one whom the Holy 
One, blessed be He, will bring into life, he 



92 



writes him in the book of the living (of life), 

by authority of MAQOM. Thou might 

perhaps say: "Since the Holy One, blessed 

be He, is sitting on a throne, they also are 

sitting when writing". (Answer): The 

Scripture teaches us (1 Kings xxii. 19, 2 

Chron. xviii. 18) : "And all the host of 

heaven are standing by him ". 

"The host of heaven " (it is said) in order to 

show us, that even the Great Princes, none 

like whom there is in the high heavens, do 

not fulfil the requests of the Shekina 

otherwise than standing. But how is it 

(possible that) they (are able to) write, when 

they are standing? 

It is like this : 

(25) One is standing on the wheels of the 

tempest and the other is standing on the 

wheels of the storm-wind. 

The one is clad in kingly garments, the other 

is clad in kingly garments. 

The one is wrapped in a mantle of majesty 

and the other is wrapped in a mantle of 

majesty. 

The one is crowned with a royal crown, and 

the other is crowned with a royal crown. 

The one's body is full of eyes, and the 

other's body is full of eyes. 

The appearance of one is like unto the 

appearance of lightnings, and the appearance 

of the other is like unto the appearance of 

lightnings. 

The eyes of the one are like the sun in its 

might, and the eyes of the other are like the 

sun in its might. 

The one's height is like the height of the 

seven heavens, and the other's height is like 

the height of the seven heavens. 

The wings of the one are as (many as) the 

days of the year, and the wings of the other 

are as (many as) the days of the year. 

The wings of the one extend over the 

breadth of Raqia', and the wings of the other 

extend over the breadth of Raqia. 

The lips of the one, are as the gates of the 

East, and the lips of the other are as the 

gates of the East. 

The tongue of the one is as high as the 

waves of the sea, and the tongue of the other 

is as high as the waves of the sea. 



From the mouth of the one a flame goes 

forth, and from the mouth of the other a 

flame goes forth. 

From the mouth of the one there go forth 

lightnings and from the mouth of the other 

there go forth lightnings. 

From the sweat of the one fire is kindled, 

and from the perspiration of the other fire is 

kindled. 

From the one's tongue a torch is burning, 

and from the tongue of the other a torch is 

burning. 

On the head of the one there is a sapphire 

stone, and upon the head of the other there is 

a sapphire stone. 

On the shoulders of the one there is a wheel 

of a swift cherub, and on the shoulders of 

the other there is a wheel of a swift cherub. 

One has in his hand a burning scroll, the 

other has in his hand a burning scroll. 

The one has in his hand a flaming style, the 

other has in his hand a flaming style. 

The length of the scroll is 3000 myriads of 

parasangs ; the size of the style is 3000 

myriads of parasangs; the size of every 

single letter that they write is 365 parasangs. 



CHAPTER XIX 
Rikbiel, the prince of the wheels of 

the Merkaba. The 
surroundings of the Merkaba. The 

commotion among 

the angeUc hosts at the time of the 

Qedushsha 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above 2 these three angels, these great 
princes there is one Prince, distinguished, 
honoured, noble, glorified, adorned, fearful, 
valiant, strong, great, magnified, glorious, 
crowned, wonderful, exalted, blameless, 
beloved, lordly, high and lofty, ancient and 
mighty, like unto whom there is none among 
the princes. His name is RIKBIEL H', the 
great and revered Prince who is standing by 
the Merkaba. 

(2) And why is he called RIKBIEL? 
Because he is appointed over the wheels of 



93 



the Merkaba, and they are given in his 
charge. 

(3) And how many are the wheels? Eight; 
two in each direction. And there are four 
winds compassing them round about. And 
these are their names: "the Storm-Wind", 
"the Tempest", "the Strong Wind", and "the 
Wind of Earthquake". 

(4) And under them four fieryrivers are 
continually running, one fiery river on each 
side. And round about them, between the 
rivers, four clouds are planted (placed), and 
these they are: "clouds of fire", "clouds of 
lamps", "clouds of coal", "clouds of 
brimstone" and they are standing over 
against [their] wheels. 

(5) And the feet of the Chayyoth are resting 
upon the wheels. And between one wheel 
and the other earthquake is roaring and 
thunder is thundering. 

(6) And when the time draws nigh for the 
recital of the Song, (then) the multitudes of 
wheels are moved, the multitude of clouds 
tremble, all the chieftains (shallishim) are 
made afraid, all the horsemen (parashim) do 
rage, all the mighty ones (gibborim) are 
excited, all the hosts (seba'im) are afrighted, 
all the troops (gedudim) are in fear, all the 
appointed ones (memunnim) haste away, all 
the princes (sarim) and armies (chayyelim) 
are dismayed, all the servants (mesharetim) 
do faint and all the angels (mal'akim) and 
divisions (degalim) travail with pain. 

(7) And one wheel makes a sound to be 
heard to the other and one Kerub to another, 
one Chayya. to another, one Seraph to 
another (saying) (Ps. Ixviii. 5) "Extol to him 
that rideth in 'Araboth, by his name Jah and 
rejoice before him!" 



CHAPTER XX 

CHAYYLIEL, the prince of the 

Chayyoth 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above these there is one great and 
mighty prince. His name is CHAYYLIEL 
H', a noble and revered prince, a glorious 
and mighty prince, a great and revered 
prince, a prince before whom all the children 



of heaven do tremble, a prince who is able to 
swallow up the whole earth in one moment 
(at a mouthful). 

(2) And why is he called CHAYYLIEL H'? 
Because he is appointed over the Holy 
Chayyoth and smites the Chayyoth with 
lashes of fire: and glorifies them, when they 
give praise and glory and rejoicing and he 
causes them to make haste to say "Holy" and 
"Blessed be the Glory of H' from his place!" 
(i.e. the Qedushshd). 

CHAPTER XXI 
The Chayyoth 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Four (are) the Chayyoth corresponding 
to the four winds. Each Chayya is as the 
space of the whole world. And each one has 
four faces ; and each face is as the face of 
the East. 

(2) Each one has four wings and each wing 
is like the cover (roof) of the universe. 

(3) And each one has faces in the middle of 
faces and wings in the middle of wings. The 
size of the faces is (as the size of) 248 faces, 
and the size of the wings is (as the size of) 
365 wings. 

(4) And every one is crowned with 2000 
crowns on his head. And each crown is like 
unto the bow in the cloud. And its splendour 
is like unto the splendour of the globe of the 
sun. And the sparks that go forth from every 
one are like the splendour of the morning 
star (planet Venus) in the East. 

CHAPTER XXII 1 

KERUBIEL, the Prince of the 

Kerubim. 

Description of the Kerubim 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above these la there is one prince, noble, 
wonderful, strong, and praised with all kinds 
of praise. His name is KERUBIEL H', a 
mighty prince, full of power and strength a 
prince of highness, and Highness (is) with 
him, a righteous prince, and righteousness 
(is) with him, a holy prince, and holiness (is) 



94 



with him, a prince glorified in (by) thousand 
hosts, exalted by ten thousand armies. 

(2) At his wrath the earth trembles, at his 
anger the camps are moved, from fear of 
him the foundations are shaken, at his 
rebuke the 'Araboth do tremble. 

(3) His stature is full of (burning) coals. The 
height of his stature is as the height of the 
seven heavens the breadth of his stature is as 
the wideness of the seven heavens and the 
thickness of his stature is as the seven 
heavens. 

(4) The opening of his mouth is like a lamp 
of fire. His tongue is a consuming fire. His 
eyebrows are like unto the splendour of the 
lightning. His eyes are like sparks of 
brilliance. His countenance is like a burning 
fire. 

(5) And there is a crown of holiness upon 
his head on which (crown) the Explicit 
Name is graven, and lightnings go forth 
from it. And the bow of Shekina is between 
his shoulders. 

(6) And his sword is like unto a lightning; 
and upon his loins there are arrows like unto 
a flame, and upon his armour and shield 
there is a consuming fire, and upon his neck 
there are coals of burning juniper and (also) 
round about him (there are coals of burning 
juniper). 

(7) And the splendour of Shekina is on his 
face ; and the horns of majesty on his 
wheels; and a royal diadem upon his skull. 

(8) And his body is full of eyes. And wings 
are covering the whole of his high stature 
(lit. the height of his stature is all wings). 

(9) On his right hand a flame is burning, and 
on his left a fire is glowing; and coals are 
burning from it. And firebrands go forth 
from his body. And lightnings are cast forth 
from his face. With him there is alway 
thunder upon (in) thunder, by his side there 
is ever earthquake upon (in) earthquake. 

(10) And the two princes of the Merkaba are 
together with him. 

(11) Why is he called KERUBIEL H', the 
Prince. Because he is appointed over the 
chariot of the Kerubim. And the mighty 
Kerubim are given in his charge. And he 
adorns the crowns on their heads and 
polishes the diadem upon their skull. 



(12)He magnifies the glory of their 
appearance. And he glorifies the beauty of 
their majesty. And he increases the greatness 
of their honour. He causes the song of their 
praise to be sung. He intensifies their 
beautiful strength. He causes the brilliance 
of their glory to shine forth. He beautifies 
their goodly mercy and lovingkindness. He 
frames the fairness of their radiance. He 
makes their merciful beauty even more 
beautiful. He glorifies their upright majesty. 
He extols the order of their praise, to 
stablish the dwellingplace of him "who 
dwelleth on the Kerubim". 

(13) And the Kerubim are standing by the 
Holy Chayyoth, and their wings are raised 
up to their heads (lit. are as the height of 
their heads) 

and Shekina is (resting) upon them 

and the brillianceof the Glory is upon their 

faces 

and song and praise in their mouth 

and their hands are under their wings 

and their feet are covered by their wings 

and horns of glory are upon their heads 

and the splendour of Shekina on their face 

and Shekina is (resting) upon them 

and sapphire stones are round about them 

and columns of fire on their four sides 

and columns of firebrands beside them. 

(14) There is one sapphire on one side and 
another sapphire on another side and under 
the sapphires 

there are coals of burning juniper. 

(15) And one Kerub is standing in each 
direction but the wings of the Kerubim 
compass each other above their skulls in 
glory; and they spread them to sing with 
them a song to him that inhabiteth the 
clouds and to praise with them the fearful 
majesty of the king of kings. 

(16) And KERUBIEL H', the prince who is 
appointed over them, he arrays them in 
comely, beautiful and pleasant orders and he 
exalts them in all manner of exaltation, 
dignity and glory. And he hastens them in 
glory and might to do the will of their 
Creator every moment. For above their lofty 
heads abides continually the glory of the 
high king "who dwelleth on the Kerubim". 



95 



CHAPTER XXII b 
(ADDITIONAL) 

(1) And there is a court before the Throne of 
Glory, 

(2) which no seraph nor angel can enter, and 
it is 36,000 myriads of parasangs, as it is 
written (Is.vi.2): "and the Seraphim are 
standing above him" (the last word of the 
scriptural passage being 'Lamech-Vav' 
[numerical value: 36]). 

(3) As the numerical value Lamech-Vav 
(36) the number of the bridges there. 

(4) And there are 24 myriads of wheels of 
fire. And the ministering angels are 12,000 
myriads. And there are 12,000 rivers of hail, 
and 12,000 treasuries of snow. And in the 
seven Halls are chariots of fire and flames, 
without reckoning, or end or searching. 

R. Ishmael said to me: Metatron, the 
angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to 
me: 

(1) How are the angels standing on high? Pie 
said: Like a bridge that is placed over a river 
so that every one can pass over it, likewise a 
bridge is placed from the beginning of the 
entry to the end. 

(2) And three ministering angels surround it 
and utter a song before YHWH, the God of 
Israel. And there are standing before it lords 
of dread and captains of fear, thousand times 
thousand and ten thousand times ten 
thousand in number and they sing praise and 
hymns before YHWH, the God of Israel. 

(3) Numerous bridges are there: bridges of 
fire and numerous bridges of hail. Also 
numerous rivers of hail, numerous treasuries 
of snow and numerous wheels offire. 

(4) And how many are the ministering 
angels? 12,000 myriads: six (thousand 
myriads) above and six (thousand myriads] 
below. And 12,000 are the treasuries of 
snow, six above and six below. And 24 
myriads of wheels of fire, 12 (myriads] 
above and 12 (myriads] below. And they 
surround the bridges and the rivers of fire 
and the rivers of hail. And there are 
numerous ministering angels, forming 
entries, for all the creatures that are standing 



in the midst thereof, corresponding to (over 
against) the paths of Raqia Shamayim. 

(5) What doeth YHWH, the God of Israel, 
the King of Glory? The Great and Fearful 
God, mighty in strength, doth cover his face. 

(6) In Araboth are 660,000 myriads of 
angels of glory standing over against the 
Throne of Glory and the divisions offlaming 
fire. And the King of Glory doth cover His 
face; for else the (Araboth Raqia 1 would be 
rent asunder in its midst because of the 
majesty, splendour, beauty, radiance, 
loveliness, brilliancy, brightness and 
excellency of the appearance of (the Holy 
One,) blessed be He. 

(7) There are numerous ministering 
angelsperforming his will, numerous kings, 
numerous princes in the 'Araboth of his 
delight, angels who are revered among the 
rulers in heaven, distinguished, adorned with 
song and bringing love to remembrance: 
(who) are affrighted by the splendour of the 
Shekina, and their eyes are dazzled by the 
shining beauty of their King, their faces 
grow black and their strength doth fail. 

(8) There go forth rivers ofjoy, streams of 
gladness, rivers of rejoicing, streams of 
triumph, rivers of love, streams of friendship 
(another reading:) of commotion and they 
flow over and go forth before the Throne of 
Glory and wax great and go through the 
gates of the paths of 'Araboth Raqia at the 
voice of the shouting and musick of the 
CHAYYOTH, at the voice of the rejoicing 
of the timbrels of his 'OPHANNIM and at 
the melody of the cymbals of His Kerubim. 
And they wax great and go forth with 
commotion with the sound of the hymn: 
"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, IS THE LORD OF 
HOSTS; THE WHOLE EARTH IS FULL 
OF HIS GLORY!" 



CHAPTER XXII c 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Prince of 
the Presence said to me: 

(1) What is the distance between one bridge 
and another? 12 myriads ofparasangs. Their 
ascent is 12 myriads of parasangs, and their 
descent 12 myriads ofparasangs. 



96 



(2) (The distance) between the rivers of 
dread and the rivers offear is 22 myriads of 
parasangs; between the rivers of hail and the 
rivers of darkness 36 myriads of parasangs; 
between the chambers of lightnings and the 
clouds of compassion 42 myriads of 
parasangs; between the clouds of 
compassion and the Merkaba 84 myriads 
ofparasangs; between the Merkaba and the 
Kerubim 148 myriads ofparasangs; between 
the Kerubim and the 'Ophannim 24 myriads 
of parasangs; between the Ophannim and the 
chambers of chambers 24 myriads of 
parasangs; between the chambers of 
chambers and the Holy Chayyoth 40,000 
myriads of parasangs; between one wing (of 
the Chayyoth) and another 12 myriads of 
parasangs; and the breadth of each one wing 
is of that same measure; and the distance 
between the Holy Chayyoth and the Throne 
of Glory is 30,000 myriads of parasangs. 

(3) And from the foot of the Throne to the 
seat there are 40,000 myriads of parasangs. 
And the name of Him that sitteth on it: let 
the name be sanctified! 

(4) And the arches of the Bow are set above 
the 'Araboth, and they are 1000 thousands 
and 10,000 times ten thousands (of 
parasangs) high. Their measure is after the 
measure of the 'Irin and Qaddishin 
(Watchers and Holy Ones). As it is written 
(Gen. ix. 13) "My bow I have set in the 
cloud". It is not written here "I will set" but 
"I have set", (i.e.) already; clouds that 
surround the Throne of Glory. As His clouds 
pass by, the angels of hail (turn into) 
burning coal. 

(5) And a fire of the voice goes down from 
by the Holy Chayyoth. And because of the 
breath of that voice they "run" (Ezek. i. 14) 
to another place, fearing lest it command 
them to go; and they "return" lest it injure 
them from the other side. Therefore "they 
run and return" (Ezek. i. 14). 

(6) And these arches of the Bow are more 
beautiful and radiant than the radiance of the 
sun during the summer solstice. And they 
are whiter than a flaming fire and they are 
great and beautiful. 

(7) Above the arches of the Bow are the 
wheels of the 'Ophannim. Their height is 
1000 thousand and 10,000 times 10,000 



units of measure after the measure of the 
Seraphim and the Troops (Gedudim). 



CHAPTER XXIII 

The winds blowing 

under the wings of the Kerubim 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) There are numerous winds blowing 
under the wings of the Kerubim. 

There blows "the Brooding Wind", as it is 
written (Gen. i. 2): " and the wind of God 
was brooding upon the face of the waters ". 

(2) There blows "the Strong Wind", as it is 
said (Ex. xiv. 21): "and the Lord caused the 
sea to go back by a strong east wind all that 
night". 

(3) There blows "the East Wind"as it is 
written (Ex. x. 13): "the east wind brought 
the locusts". 

(4) There blows "the Wind of Quails" as it is 
written (Num. xi. 31): "And there went forth 
a wind from the Lord and brought quails". 

(5) There blows "the Wind of Jealousy" as it 
is written (Num.v.l4): "And the wind of 
jealousy came upon him". 

(6) There blows the "Wind of Earthquake" 
as it is written (i Kings .xix. 1 1): "and after 
that the wind of the earthquake ; but the 
Lord was not in the earthquake". 

(7) There blows the "Wind of H' " as it is 
written (Ex. xxxvii. i) : "and he carried me 
out by the wind of H' and set me down". 

(8) There blows the "Evil Wind " as it is 
written (i Sam. xvi. 23): "and the evil wind 
departed from him". 

(9) There blow the "Wind of Wisdom" Sand 
the "Wind of Understanding" and the "Wind 
of Knowledge" and the "Wind of the Fear of 
H'" as it is written (Is. xi. 2): "And the wind 
of H'shall rest upon him; the wind of 
wisdom and understanding, the wind of 
counsel and might, the wind of knowledge 
and of the fear. 

(10) There blows the "Wind of Rain", as it is 
written (Prov. xxv. 23): "the north wind 
bringeth forth rain". 

(11) There blows the "Wind of Lightnings ", 
as it is written (Jer.x.l3, li. 16): "he maketh 



97 



lightnings for the rain and bringeth forth the 
wind out of his treasuries ". 
(12)There blows the "Wind, Breaking the 
Rocks", as it is written (i Kings xix. n): "the 
Lord passed by and a great and strong wind 
(rent the mountains and brake in pieces the 
rocks before the Lord)". 

(13) There blows the "Wind of Assuagement 
of the Sea", as it is written (Gen. viii. i): 
"and God made a wind to pass over the 
earth, and the waters assuaged". 

(14) There blows the "Wind of Wrath", as it 
is written (Job i. 19) : "and behold there 
came a great wind from the wilderness and 
smote the four corners of the house and it 
fell". 

(15) There blows the " Storm- Wind ", as it is 
written (Ps. cxlviii. 8) : "Storm- wind, 
fulfilling his word". 

(16) And Satan is standing among these 
winds, for "storm-wind " is nothing else but 
"Satan", and all these winds do not blow but 
under the wings of the Kerubim, as it is 
written (Ps. xviii. n) : "and he rode upon a 
cherub and did fly, yea, and he flew swiftly 
upon the wings of the wind". 

(17) And whither go all these winds? The 
Scripture teaches us, that they go out from 
under the wings of the Kerubim and descend 
on the globe of the sun, as it is written (Eccl. 
i. 6) : " The wind goeth toward the south and 
tumeth about unto the north ; it turneth 
about continually in its course and the wind 
14 retumeth again to its circuits ". And from 
the globe of the sun they return and descend 
upon the rivers and the seas, upon] the 
mountains and upon the hills, as it is written 
(Am.iv.13): "For lo, he that formeth the 
mountains and createth the wind". 

(18) And from the mountains and the hills 
they return and descend to the seas and the 
rivers ; and from the seas and the rivers they 
return and descend upon (the) cities and 
provinces ; and from the cities and provinces 
they return and descend into the Garden, and 
from the Garden they return and descend to 
Eden, as it is written (Gen.iii. 8): "walking 
in the Garden in the wind of day". And in 
the midst of the Garden they join together 
and blow from one side to the other and are 
perfumed with the spices of the Garden even 



from \ts remotest parts, until they separate 
from each other, and, filled 
with the scent of the pure spices, they bring 
the odour from the remotest parts of Eden 
and the spices of the Garden to the righteous 
and godly who in the time to come shall 
inherit the Garden of Eden and the Tree of 
Life, as it is written (Cant. iv. 16) : "Awake, 
O north wind; and come thou south; blow 
upon my garden, that the spices thereof may 
flow out. Let my beloved come into his 
garden and eat his precious fruits". 



CHAPTER XXIV 

The different chariots of the Holy 

One, blessed be He 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, the glory of all 
heaven, said to me : 

(1) Numerous chariots has the Holy One, 
blessed be He: 

He has the "Chariots of (the) Kerubim", as it 
is written (Ps. xviii. 11, 2 Sam.xxii.ll): "And 
he rode upon a cherub and did fly". 

(2) He has the "Chariots of Wind", as it is 
written (ib.) : "and he flew swiftly upon the 
wings of the wind ". 

(3) He has the "Chariots of (the) Swift 
Cloud", as it is written (Is. xix. i): "Behold, 
the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud". 

(4) He has "the Chariots of Clouds", as it is 
written (Ex. xix. 9): "Lo, I come unto thee in 
a cloud". 

(5) He has the "Chariots of the Altar", as it is 
written (Am. ix. i) :"I saw the Lord standing 
upon the Altar". 

(6) He has the "Chariots of Ribbotaim", as it 
is written (Ps.Ixviii. 18) : "The chariots of 
God are Ribbotaim ; thousands of angels ". 

(7) He has the "Chariots of the Tent", as it is 
written (Deut.xxxi. 15) : "And the Lord 
appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud ". 

(8) He has the "Chariots of the Tabernacle", 
as it is written (Lev. i. 1): "And the Lord 
spake unto him out of the tabernacle". 

(9) He has the "Chariots of the Mercy-Seat", 
as it is written (Num. vii. 89): "then he heard 
the Voice speaking unto him from upon the 
mercy-seat". 



98 



(10) He has the "Chariots of Sapphire 
Stone", as it is written (Ex. xxiv. 10) : "and 
there was under his feet as it were a paved 
work of sapphire stone". 

(1 1) He has the "Chariots of Eagles ", as it is 
written (Ex. xix. 4) :"I bare you on eagles' 
wings". Eagles literally are not meant here 
but "they that fly swiftly as eagles". 
(12)He has the "chariots of Shout", as it is 
written (Ps. xlvii. 6) :"God is gone up with a 
shout". 

(13) He has the "Chariots of 'Araboth", as it 
is written (Ps.Ixviii. 5): "Extol Him that 
rideth upon the 'Araboth". 

(14) He has the "Chariots of Thick Clouds", 
as it is written (Ps. civ. 3): "who maketh the 
thick clouds His chariot". 

(15) He has the "Chariots of the Chayyoth", 
as it is written (Ezek. i. 14) : "and the 
Chayyoth 

ran and returned". They run by permission 
and return by permission, for Shekina is 
above their heads. 

(16) He has the "Chariots of Wheels 
(Galgallim)", as it is written (Ezek. x. 2): 
"And he said: Go in between the whirling 
wheels". 

(17) lie has the "Chariots of a Swift Kerub", 
as it is written (Ps.xviii.lO &amp; Is.xix.l): 
"riding on a swift cherub". 

And at the time when He rides on a swift 
kerub, as he sets one of His feet upon him, 
before he sets the other foot upon his back, 
he looks through eighteen thousand worlds 
at one glance. And he discerns and sees into 
them all and knows what is in all of them 
and then he sets down the other foot upon 
him, according as it is written (Ezek. xlviii. 
35): "Round about eighteen thousand". 
Whence do we know that He looks through 
every one of them every day? It is written 
(Ps. xiv. 2): "He looked down from heaven 
upon the children of men to see if there were 
any that did understand, 
that did seek after God". 

(18) He has the "Chariots of the 'Ophannim", 
as it is written 

(Ezek. X. 12): "and the 'Ophannim were full 
of eyes round about". 12 

(19) He has the "Chariots of His Holy 
Throne", as it is written (Ps. xlvii. 8) :" God 
sitteth upon his holy throne ". 



(20) He has the "chariots of the Throne of 
Yah", as it is written (Ex. xvii. 16) : 
"Because a hand is lifted up upon the 
Throne of Jah". 

(21) He has the "Chariots of the Throne of 
Judgement", as it is written (Is. v. 16): "but 
the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in 
judgment". 

(22) He has the "Chariots of the Throne of 
Glory ", as it is written (Jer. xvii. 12) : "The 
Throne of Glory, set on high from the 
beginning, is the place of our sanctuary". 

(23) He has the "Chariots of the High and 
Exalted Throne", as it is written (Is. vi. i): "I 
saw the Lord sitting upon the high and 
exalted throne". 



CHAPTER XXV 
'Ophphanniel, the prince of the 

'Ophannim. 
Description of the 'Ophannim 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above these there is one great prince, 
revered, high, lordly, fearful, ancient and 
strong. 'OPHPHANNIEL H is his name. 

(2) He has sixteen faces, four faces on each 
side,(also) hundred wings on each side. And 
he has 8466 eyes, corresponding to the days 
of the year. [2190 -and some say 2116- on 
each side.] [2191 /2196 and sixteen on each 
side.] 

(3) And those two eyes of his face, in each 
one of them lightnings are flashing, and 
from each one of them firebrands are 
burning ; and no creature is able to behold 
them : for anyone who looks at them is burnt 
instantly. 

(4) His height is (as) the distance of 2500 
years' journey. No eye can behold and no 
mouth can tell the mighty power of his 
strength save the King of kings, the Holy 
One, blessed be He, alone. 

(5) Why is he called 'OPHPHANNIEL ? 
Because he is appointed over the 'Ophannim 
and the 'Ophannimare given in his charge. 
He stands every day and attends and 
beautifies them. And he exalts and orders 
their apartment and polishes their standing- 



99 



place and makes bright their dwellings, 
makes their comers even and cleanses their 
seats. And he waits upon them early and 
late, by day and by night, to increase their 
beauty, to make great their dignity and to 
make them "diligent in praise of their 
Creator. 

(6) And all the 'Ophannim are full of eyes, 
and they are all full of brightness; seventy 
two sapphire stones are fixed on their 
garments on their right side and seventy two 
sapphire stones are fixed on their garments 
on their left side. 

(7) And four carbuncle stones are fixed on 
the crown of every single one, the splendour 
of which proceeds in the four directions of 
'Araboth even as the splendour of the globe 
of the sun proceeds in 

all the directions of the universe. And why is 
it called Carbuncle (Bareqet)? Because its 
splendour is like the appearance of a 
lightning (Baraq). And tents of splendour, 
tents of brilliance, tents of brightness as of 
sapphire and carbuncle inclose them because 
of the shining appearance of their eyes. 



CHAPTER XXVI 

SERAPHIEL, the Prince of the 

Seraphim. 

Description of the Seraphim 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above these there is one prince, 
wonderful, noble, great, honourable, mighty, 
terrible, a chief and leader 1 and a swift 
scribe, glorified, honoured and beloved. 

(2) He is altogether filled with splendour, 
full of praise and shining; and he is wholly 
full of brilliance, of light and of beauty; and 
the whole of him is filled with goodliness 
and greatness. 

(3) His countenance is altogether like (that 
of) angels, but his body is like an eagle's 
body. 

(4) His splendour is like unto lightnings, his 
appearance like fire brands, his beauty like 
unto sparks, his honour like fiery coals, his 
majesty like chashmals, his radiance like the 
light of the planet Venus. 



The image of him is like unto the Greater 
Light. His height is as the seven heavens. 
The light from his eyebrows is like the 
sevenfold light. 

(5) The sapphire stone upon his head is as 
great as the whole universe and like unto the 
splendour of the very heavens in radiance. 

(6) His body is full of eyes like the stars of 
the sky, innumerable and unsearchable. 
Every eye is like the planet Venus. Yet, 
there are some of them like the Lesser Light 
and some of them like unto the Greater 
Light. From his ankles to his knees (they 
are) like unto stars of lightning, from his 
knees to his thighs like unto the planet 
Venus, from his thighs to his loins like unto 
the moon, from his loins to his neck like the 
sun, from his neck to his skull like unto the 
Light Imperishable. (Cf. Zeph. iii. 5.) 

(7) The crown on his head is like unto the 
splendour of the Throne of Glory. The 
measure of the crown is the distance of 502 
years' joumey. There is no kind of 
splendour, no kind of brilliance, no kind of 
radiance, no kind of light in the universe but 
is fixed on that crown. 

(8) The name of that prince is SERAPHIEL 
H". And the crown on his head, its name is 
"the Prince of Peace". And why is he called 
by the name of SERAPHIEL '? Because he 
is appointed over the Seraphim. And the 
flaming Seraphim are given in his charge. 
And he presides over them by day and by 
night and teaches them song, praise, 
proclamation of beauty, might and majesty; 
that they may proclaim the beauty of their 
King in all manner of Praise and 
Sanctification (Qedushsha). 

(9) How many are the Seraphim? Four, 
corresponding to the four winds of the 
world. And how many wings have they each 
one of them? Six, corresponding to the six 
days of Creation. And how 

many faces have they? Each one of them 
four faces. 

(10) The measure of the Seraphim and the 
height of each one of them correspond to the 
height of the seven heavens. The size of 
each wing is like the measure of all Raqia' . 
The size of each face is like that of the face 
of the East. 



100 



(11) And each one of them gives forth light 
like unto the splendour of the Throne of 
Glory: so that not even the Holy Chayyoth, 
the honoured 'Ophannim, nor the majestic 
KeruUm are able to behold it. For everyone 
who beholds it, his eyes are darkened 
because of its great splendour. 

(12) Why are they called Seraphim? 
Because they burn (saraph) the writing 
tables of Satan : Every day Satan is sitting, 
together with SAMMAEL, the Prince of 
Rome, and with DUBBIEL, the Prince of 
Persia, and they write the iniquities of Israel 
on writing tables which they hand over to 
the Seraphim, in order that they may present 
them before the Holy One, blessed be He, so 
that He may destroy Israel from the world. 
But the Seraphim know from the secrets of 
the Holy One, blessed be He, that he desires 
not, that this people Israel should perish. 
What do the Seraphim? Every day do they 
receive (accept) them from the hand of 
Satan and burn them in the burning fire over 
against the high and exalted Throne in order 
that they may not come before the Holy 
One, blessed be He, at the time when he is 
sitting upon the Throne of Judgement, 
judging the whole world in truth. 

CHAPTER XXVII 

RADWERIEL, the keeper of the 

Book of Records 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel of 
H', the Prince of the Presence, said to me 

(1) Above the Seraphim there is one prince, 
exalted above all the princes, wondrous 
more than all the servants. His name is 
RADWERIEL H' who is appointed over the 
treasuries of the books. 

(2) He fetches forth the Case of Writings 
(with) the Book of Records in it, and brings 
it before the Holy One, blessed be He. And 
he breaks the seals of the case, opens it, 
takes out the books and delivers them before 
the Holy One, blessed be He. And the Holy 
One, blessed be He, receives them of his 
hand and gives them in his sight to the 
Scribes, that they may read them in the 
Great Beth Din (The court of justice) in the 



height of 'Araboth Raqia', before the 
heavenly household. 

(3) And why is he called RADWERIEL? 
Because out of every word that goes forth 
from his mouth an angel is created : and he 
stands in the songs (in the singing company) 
of the ministering angels and utters a song 
before the Holy One, blessed be He when 
the time draws nigh for the recitation of the 
(Thrice) Holy. 

CHAPTER XXVIII 
The Trin and Qaddishin 

R. Ishmael said : Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Above all these there are four great 
princes, Irin and Qaddishin by name: high, 
honoured, revered, beloved, wonderful and 
glorious ones, greater than all the children of 
heaven. There is none like unto them among 
all the celestial princes and none their equal 
among all the Servants. For each one of 
them is equal to all the rest together. 

(2) And their dwelling is over against the 
Throne of Glory, and their standing place 
over against the Holy One, blessed be He, 
so that the brilliance of their dwelling is a 
reflection of the brilliance of the Throne of 
Glory. And the splendour of their 
countenance is a reflection of the splendour 
of Shekina. 

(3) And they are glorified by the glory of 
4the Divine Majesty (Gebura) and praised 
by (through) the praise of Shekina. 

(4) And not only that, but the Holy One, 
blessed be He, does nothing in his world 
without first consulting them, but after that 
he doeth it. As it is written (Dan. iv. 17) : 
"The sentence is by the decree of the 'Irin 
and the demand by the word of the 
Qaddishin." 

(5) The Urin are two and the Qaddishin are 
two. And how are they standing before the 
Holy One, blessed be He? It is to be 
understood, that one 'Ir is standing on one 
side and the other 'Ir on the other side, and 
one Qaddish is standing on one side and the 
other on the other side. 

(6) And ever do they exalt the humble, and 
they abase to the ground those that are 



101 



proud, and they exalt to the height those that 
are humble. 

(7) And every day, as the Holy One, blessed 
be He, is sitting upon the Throne of 
Judgement and judges the whole world, and 
the Books of the Living and the Books of 
the Dead are opened before Him, then all 
the children of heaven are standing before 
him in fear, dread, awe and trembling. At 
that time, (when) the Holy One, blessed be 
He, is sitting upon the Throne of Judgement 
to execute judgement, his garment is white 
as snow, the hair on his head as pure wool 
and the whole of his cloak is like the shining 
light. And he is covered with righteousness 
all over as with a coat of mail. 

(8) And those 'Irm and Qaddishin are 
standing before him like court officers 
before the judge. And they raise and argue 
every case and close the case that comes 
before the Holy One, blessed be He, in 
judgement, according as it is written (Dan. 
iv. 17) : "The sentence is by the decree of 
the Irm and the demand by the word of the 
Qaddishin" 

(9) Some of them argue and others pass the 
sentence in the Great Beth Din in 'Araboth. 
Some of them make the requests from 
before uthe Divine Majesty and some close 
the cases before the Most 

High. Others finish by going down and 
(confirming ) executing the sentences on 
earth below. According as it is written (Dan. 
iv. 13 , 14) : " Behold an 'Ir and a 
Qaddishcame down from heaven and cried 
aloud and said thus. Hew down the tree, and 
cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, 
and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away 
from under it, and the fowls from his 
branches ". 

(10) Why are they called 'Irin and 
Qaddishint By reason that they sanctify the 
body and the spirit with lashes of fire on the 
third day of the judgement, as it is written 
(Hos. vi. 2): "After two days will he revive 
us : on the third he will raise us up, and we 
shall live before him." 



CHAPTER XXIX 

Description of a class of angels 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence,said to me: 

(1) Each one of them has seventy names 
corresponding to the seventy tongues of the 
world. And all of them are (based) upon the 
name of the Holy One, blessed be He. And 
every several name is written with a flaming 
style upon the Fearful Crown (Keiher Nora) 
which is on the head of the high and exalted 
King. 

(2) And from each one of them there go 
forth sparks and lightnings. And each one of 
them is beset with horns of splendour round 
about. From each one lights are shining 
forth, and each one is surrounded by tents of 
brilliance so that not even the Seraphim and 
the Chayyoth who are greater than all the 
children of heaven are able to behold them. 



CHAPTER XXX 

The 72 princes of Kingdoms and 

the Prince of the World 

officiating at the Great Sanhedrin 

in heaven 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me: 

(1) Whenever the Great Beth Din is seated 
in the 'Araboth Raqia' on high there is no 
opening of the mouth for anyone in the 
world save those great princes who are 
called H' by the name of the Holy One, 
blessed be He. 

(2) How many are those princes? Seventy- 
two princes of the kingdoms of the world 
besides the Prince of the World who speaks 
(pleads) in favour of the world before the 
Holy One, blessed be He, every day, at the 
hour when the book is opened in which are 
recorded all the doings of the world, 
according as it is written (Dan.vii.lO) : "The 
judgement was set and the books were 
opened." 



102 



CHAPTER XXXI 

(The attributes of) Justice, Mercy 

and Truth 

by the Throne of Judgement 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence,said to me : 

(1) At the time when the Holy One, blessed 
be He, is sitting on the Throne, of 
Judgement, (then) Justice is standing on His 
right and Mercy on His left and Truth before 
His face. 

(2) And when man enters before Him to 
judgement,(then) there comes forth from the 
splendour of the Mercy towards him as (it 
were) a staff and stands in front of him. 
Forthwith man falls upon his face, (and) all 
the angels of destruction fear and tremble 
before him, according as it is written (Is.xvi. 
5): "And with mercy shall the throne be 
established, and he shall sit upon it in truth." 



CHAPTER XXXII 

The execution ofjudgement on the 

wicked. God's sword 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) When the Holy One, blessed be He, 
opens the Book half of which is fire and half 
flame, (then) they go out from before Him in 
every moment to execute the judgement on 
the wicked by His sword 

(that is) drawn forth out of its sheath and the 
splendour of which shines like a lightning 
and pervades the world from one end to the 
other, as it is written (Is. Ixvi. 16): "For by 
fire will the Lord plead (and by his sword 
with all flesh)." 

(2) And all the inhabitants of the world (lit. 
those who come into the world) fear and 
tremble before Him, when they behold His 
sharpened sword like unto a lightning from 
one end of the world to the other, and sparks 
and flashes of the size of the stars of Raqia' 
going out from it; according as it is written 
(Deut. xxxii. 41):" If I whet the lightning of 
my sword". 



CHAPTER XXXIII 

The angels of Mercy, of Peace and 

of Destruction by 

the Throne ofjudgement. The 

scribes, (vss. i, 2) 

The angels by the Throne of Glory 

and the 

fiery rivers under it. (vss. 3-5) 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) At the time that the Holy One, blessed be 
He, is sitting on the Throne of Judgement, 
(then) the angels of Mercy are standing on 
His right, the angels of Peace are standing 
on His left and the angels of Destruction are 
standing in front of Him. 

(2) And one scribe is standing beneath Him, 
and another scribe above Him. 

(3) And the glorious Seraphimsurround the 
Throne on its four sides with walls of 
lightnings, and the 'Ophannim. surround 
them with fire-brands round about the 
Throne of Glory. And clouds of fire and 
clouds of flames compass them to the right 
and to the left; and the Holy Chayyoth carry 
the Throne of Glory from below: each one 
with three fingers. The measure of the 
fingers of each one is 800,000 and 700 times 
hundred, (and) 66,000 parasangs. 

(4) And underneath the feet of the Chayyoth 
seven fiery rivers are running and flowing. 
And the breadth of each river is 365 
thousand parasangs and its depth is 248 
thousand myriads of parasangs. Its length is 
unsearchable and immeasureable. 

(5) And each river turns round in a bow in 
the four directions of 'Araboth Raqict , and 
(from there) it falls down to Ma'on and is 
stayed, and from Mai on to Zebul, from 
Zebul to Shechaqim, from Shechaqim to 
Raqia' , from Raqia' to Shamayim and from 
Shamayim upon the heads of the wicked 
who are in Gehenna, as it is written (Jer. 
xxiii. 19): "Behold a whirlwind of the Lord, 
even his fury, is gone, yea, a whirling 
tempest; it shall burst upon the head of the 
wicked". 



103 



CHAPTER XXXIV 

The different concentric circles 

round the Chayyoth, consisting 

offire, water, hailstones etc. and of 

the angels uttering 

the Qedushsha responsorium 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron; the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) The hoofs of the Chayyoth are 
surrounded by seven clouds of burning 
coals. The clouds of burning coals are 
surrounded on the outside by seven walls of 
flame(s). The seven walls of flame(s) are 
surrounded on the outside by seven walls of 
hailstones (stones of 'Et-gabish, Ezek. xiii. 
11,13, xxviii. 22). The hailstones are 
surrounded on the outside by xstones of hail 
(stone of Barad). The stones of hail are 
surrounded on the outside by stones of "the 
wings of the tempest ". 

The stones of "the wings of the tempest" are 
surrounded on the outside by flames of fire. 
The flames of fire are surrounded by the 
chambers of the whirlwind. The chambers of 
the whirlwind are surrounded on the outside 
by the fire and the water. 

(2) Round about the fire and the water are 
those who utter the "Holy". Round about 
those who utter the "Holy" are those who 
utter the "Blessed"'. Round about those who 
utter the "Blessed" are the bright clouds. The 
bright clouds are surrounded on the outside 
by coals of burning jumper ; and on the 
outside surrounding the coals of burning 
juniper there are thousand camps of fire and 
ten thousand hosts of flame(s). And between 
every several camp and every several host 
there is a cloud, so that they may not be 
burnt by the fire. 



CHAPTER XXXV 

The camps of angels in ' Araboth 

Raqia: angels, performing the 

Qedushsha 



1 R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, 



the Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) 506 thousand myriads of camps has the 
Holy One, blessed be He, in the height of 
'Araboth Raqia. And each camp is 
(composed of) 496 thousand angels. 

(2) And every single angel, the height of his 
stature is as the great sea; and the 
appearance of their countenance as the 
appearance of the lightning, and their eyes 
as lamps of fire, and their arms and their feet 
like in colour to polished brass and the 
roaring voice of their words like the voice of 
a multitude. 

(3) And they are all standing before the 
Throne of Glory in four rows. And the 
princes of the army are standing at the head 
of each row. 

(4) And some of them utter the "Holy" and 
others utter the "Blessed", some of them run 
as messengers, others are standing in 
attendance, according as it is written (Dan. 
vii. 10): "Thousand 

thousands ministered unto him, and ten 
thousand times ten thousand stood before 
him : the judgment was set and the books 
were opened ". 

(5) And in the hour, when the time draws 
nigh for to say the "Holy", (then) first there 
goes forth a whirlwind from before the Holy 
One, blessed be He, and bursts upon the 
camp of Shekina and there arises a great 
commotion among them, as it is written 
(Jer.xxx. 23): "Behold, the whirlwind of the 
Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing 
commotion". 

(6) At that moment 4thousand thousands of 
them are changed into sparks, thousand 
thousands of them into firebrands, thousand 
thousands into flashes, thousand thousands 
into flames, thousand thousands into males, 
thousand thousands into females, thousand 
thousands into winds, thousand thousands 
into burning fires, thousand thousands into 
flames, thousand thousands into sparks, 
thousand thousands into chashmals of light; 
until they take upon themselves the yoke of 
the kingdom of heaven, the high and lifted 
up, of the Creator of them all with fear, 
dread, awe and trembling, with commotion, 
anguish, terror and trepidation. Then they 
are changed again into their former shape to 



104 



have the fear of their King before them 
alway, as they have set their hearts on 
saying the Song continually, as it is written 
(Is. vi. 3): "And one cried unto another and 
said (Holy, Holy, Holy, etc.)". 



CHAPTER XXXVI 

The angels bathe in the fiery river 

before reciting the 'Song' 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) At the time when the ministering angels 
desire to say (the) Song, (then) Nehar di-Nur 
(the fiery stream) rises with many thousand 
thousands and myriads of myriads" (of 
angels) of power and strength of fire and it 
runs and passes under the Throne of Glory, 
between the camps of the ministering angels 
and the troops of 'Araboth. 

(2) And all the ministering angels first go 
down into Nehar di-Nur, and they dip 
themselves in the fire and dip their tongue 
and their mouth seven times ; and after that 
they go up and put on the garment of 
'Machaqe Samal' and cover themselves with 
cloaks of chashmal and stand in four rows 
over against the Throne of Glory, in all the 
heavens. 



CHAPTER XXXVII 

The four camps of Shekina and 

their surroundings 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) In the seven Halls there are standing four 
chariots of Shekina, and before each one are 
standing the four camps of Shekina. 
Between each camp a river of fire is 
continually flowing. 

(2) Between each river there are bright 
clouds [surrounding them], and between 
each cloud there are put up pillars of 
brimstone. Between one pillar and another 
there are standing flaming wheels, 
surrounding them. And between one wheel 



and another there are flames of fire round 
about. Between one flame and another there 
are treasuries of lightnings; behind the 
treasuries of lightnings are the wings of the 
storm wind. Behind the wings of the storm- 
wind are the chambers of the tempest; 
behind the chambers of the tempest there are 
winds, voices, thunders, sparks [upon] 
sparks and earthquakes [upon] earthquakes. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII 

The fear that befalls all the heavens 

at the sound of the 

'Holy? esp. the heavenly bodies. 

These appeased by the 

Prince of the World 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) At the time, when the ministering angels 
utter (the Thrice) Holy, then all the pillars of 
the heavens and their sockets do tremble, 
and the gates of the Halls of Araboth Raqia' 
are shaken and the foundations of 
Shechaqim and the Universe (Tebel) are 
moved, and the orders of Ma'on and the 
chambers of Makon quiver, and all the 
orders of Raqia and the constellations and 
the planets are dismayed, and the globes of 
the sun and the moon haste away and flee 
out of their courses and run 12,000 
parasangs and seek to throw themselves 
down from heaven, 

(2) by reason of the roaring voice of their 
chant, and the noise of their praise and the 
sparks and lightnings that go forth from their 
faces; as it is written (Ps. Ixxvii. 18): "The 
voice of thy thunder was in the heaven (the 
lightnings lightened the world, the earth 
trembled and shook) ". 

(3) Until the prince of the world calls them, 
saying: "Be ye quiet in your place ! Fear not 
because of the ministering angels who sing 
the Song before the Holy One, blessed be 
He". As it is written (Job.xxxviii. 7): "When 
the morning stars sang together and all the 
children of heaven shouted for joy". 



105 



CHAPTER XXXIX 

The explicit names fly offfrom the 

Throne and all the 

various angelic hosts prostrate 

themselves before it at 

the time of the Qedushsha 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) When the ministering angels utter the 
"Holy" then all the explicit names that are 
graven with a flaming style on the Throne of 
Glory fly off like eagles, with sixteen wings. 
And they surround and 

compass the Holy One, blessed be He, on 
the four sides of the place of His Shekinal. 

(2) And the angels of the host, and the 
flaming Servants, and the mighty 
'Ophannim, and the Kerubim of the Shekina, 
and the Holy Chayyoth, and the Seraphim, 
and the 'Er'ellim, and the Taphsarim and the 
troops of consuming fire, and the fiery 
armies, and the flaming hosts, and the holy 
princes, adorned with crowns, clad in kingly 
majesty, wrapped in glory, girt with 
loftiness, 4 fall upon their faces three times, 
saying: "Blessed be the name of His glorious 
kingdom for ever and ever". 

CHAPTER XL 

The ministering angels rewarded 

with crowns, when uttering 

the "Holy" in its right order, 

andpunished by consuming fire 

if not. New ones created in the stead 

of the consumed angels 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) When the ministering angels say "Holy" 
before the Holy One, blessed be He, in the 
proper way, then the servants of His Throne, 
the attendants of His Glory, go forth with 
great mirth from under the Throne of Glory. 

(2) And they all carry in their hands, each 
one of them thousand thousand and ten 
thousand times ten thousand crowns of stars, 
similar in appearance to the planet Venus, 
and put them on the ministering angels and 



the great princes who utter the "Holy". 
Three crowns they put on each one of them: 
one crown because they say "Holy", another 
crown, because they say "Holy, Holy", and a 
third crown because they say "Holy, Holy, 
Holy, is the Lord of Hosts" . 

(3) And in the moment that they do not utter 
the "Holy" in the right order, a consuming 
fire goes forth from the little finger of the 
Holy One, blessed be He, and falls down in 
the midst of their ranksand is divided into 
496 thousand parts corresponding to the four 
camps of the ministering angels, and 
consumes them in one moment, as it is 
written (Ps. xcvii. 3): "A fire goeth before 
him and burneth up his adversaries round 
about". 

(4) After that the Holy One, blessed be He, 
opens His mouth and speaks one word and 
creates others in their stead, new ones like 
them. And each one stands before His 
Throne of Glory, uttering the "Holy", as it is 
written (Lam. iii. 23): "They are new every 
morning; great is thy faithfulness". 



CHAPTER XLI 
Metatron shows R. Ishmael the 

letters engraved on 

the Throne of Glory by which 

letters everything in 

heaven and earth has been created 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Come and behold the letters by which 
the heaven and theearth were created, the 
letters by which were created the mountains 
and hills, the letters by which were created 
the seas and rivers, the letters by which were 
created the trees and herbs, the letters by 
which were created the planets and the 
constellations, the letters by which were 
created the globe of the moon and the globe 
of the sun, Orion, the Pleiades and all the 
different luminaries of Raqia' . 

(2) the letters by which were created the 
Throne of Glory and the Wheels of the 



106 



Merkaba, the letters by which were created 
the necessities of the worlds, 

(3) the letters by which were created 
wisdom, understanding, knowledge, 
prudence, meekness and righteousness by 
which the whole world is sustained. 

(4) And I walked by his side and he took me 
by his hand and raised me upon his wings 
and showed me those letters, all of them, 
that are graven with a flaming style on the 
Throne of Glory : and sparks 

go forth from them and cover all the 
chambers of 'Araboth. 



CHAPTER XLII 

Instances of polar opposites kept in 

balance by several 

Divine Names and other similar 

wonders 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the 
Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Come and I will show thee, where the 
waters are suspended in the highest, where 
fire is burning in the midst of hail, where 
lightnings lighten out of the midst of snowy 
mountains, where thunders are roaring in the 
celestial heights, where a flame is burning in 
the midst of the burning fire and where 
voices make themselves heard in the midst 
of thunder and earthquake. 

(2) Then I went by his side and he took me 
by his hand and lifted me up on his wings 
and showed me all those things. I beheld the 
waters suspended on high in 'Araboth Raqia' 
by (force of) the name YAH 'EHYE 
ASHER 'EHYE (Jah, I am that I am). 

And their fruits going down from heaven 
and watering the face of the world, as it is 
written (Ps.civ.l3): "(He watereth the 
mountains from his chambers :) the earth is 
satisfied with the fruit of thy work". 

(3) And I saw fire and snow and hailstone 
that were mingled together within each other 
and yet were undamaged, by (force of) the 
name 'ESH 'OKELA (consuming fire), as it 
is written (Deut. iv. 24) : 'Tor the Lord, thy 
God, is a consuming fire". 

(4) And I saw lightnings that were 
lightening out of mountains of snow and yet 



were not damaged (quenched), by (force of) 
the name YAH SUR 'OLAMIM (Jah, the 
everlasting rock), as it is written (Is. xxvi. 
4): "For in Jah, YHWH, the everlasting 
rock". 

(5) And I saw thunders and voices that were 
roaring in the midst of fiety flames and were 
not damaged (silenced), by (force of) the 
name TL-SHADDAI RABBA (the Great 
God Almighty) as it is written (Gen. xvii. i): 
"I am God Almighty". 

(6) And I beheld a flame (and) a glow 
(glowing flames) that were flaming and 
glowing in the midst of burning fire, and yet 
were not damaged (devoured), by (force of) 
the name YAD 'AL KES YAH 

(the hand upon the Throne of the Lord) as it 
is written (Ex. xvii. 16) : " And he said: for 
the hand is upon the Throne of the Lord ". 

(7) And I beheld rivers of fire in the midst of 
rivers of water and they were not damaged 
(quenched) by (force of) the name 'OSE 
SHALOM (Maker of Peace) as it is written 
(Job XXV. 2): "He maketh peace in his high 
places". For he makes peace between the fire 
and the water, between the hail and the fire, 
between the wind and the cloud, between the 
earthquake and the sparks. 



CHAPTER XLHI 
Metatron shows R. Ishmael the 

abode of the unborn spirits 

and of the spirits of the righteous 

dead 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: 

(1) Come and I will show thee 1 where arel 
the spirits of the righteous that have been 
created and have returned, and the spirits of 
the righteous that have not yet been created. 

(2) And he lifted me up to his side, took me 
by his hand and lifted me up near the Throne 
of Glory by the place of the Shekina ; and he 
revealed the Throne of Glory to me, and he 
showed me the spirits that have been created 
and had returned : and they were flying 
above the Throne of Glory before the Holy 
One, blessed be He. 



107 



(3) After that I went to interpret the 
following verse of Scripture and I found in 
what is written (Isa.Ivii. 16): "for the spirit 
clothed itself before me, and the souls I have 
made" that ("for the spirit was clothed 
before me") means the spirits that have been 
created in the chamber of creation of the 
righteous and that have returned before the 
Holy One, blessed be He; (and the words:) 
"and the souls I have made" refer to the 
spirits 4 of the righteous that have not yet 
been created in the chamber (GUPH). 



CHAPTER XLIV 

Metatron shows R. Ishmael the 

abode of the wicked 

and the intermediate in Sheol. (vss. 

1-6) 

The Patriarchs pray for the 

deliverance of Israel 

(vss. 7-10) 

R. Ishmael said: Metatron, x the Angel, 
the Prince of the Presence, said to me : 

(1) Come and I will show thee the spirits of 
the wicked and the spirits of the 
intermediate where they are standing, and 
the spirits of the intermediate, whither they 
go down. Sand the spirits of the wicked, 
where they go down. 

(2) And he said to me : The spirits of the 
wicked go down to She'ol by the hands of 
two angels of destruction: ZA'APHIEL and 
SIMKIEL are their names. 

(3) SIMKIEL is appointed over the 
intermediate to support them and purify 
them because of the great mercy of the 
Prince of the Place (Maqom). ZA'APHIEL 
is appointed over the spirits of the wicked in 
order to cast them down from the presence 
of the Holy One, blessed be He, and from 
the splendour of the Shekina to She'ol, to be 
punished in the fire of Gehenna with staves 
of burning coal. 

(4) And I went by his side, and he took me 
by his hand and showed me all of them with 
his fingers. 

(5) And I beheld the appearance of their 
faces (and, lo, it was) as the appearance of 
children of men, and their bodies like eagles. 



And not only that but (furthermore) the 
colour of the countenance of the 
intermediate was like pale grey on account 
of their deeds, for there are stains upon them 
until they have become cleaned from their 
iniquity in the fire. 

(6) And the colour of the wicked was like 
the bottom of a pot on account of the 
wickedness of their doings. 

(7) And I saw the spirits of the Patriarchs 
Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the rest of the 
righteous whom they have brought up out of 
their graves and who have ascended to the 
Heaven (Raqirf). And 

they were praying before the Holy One, 
blessed be He, saying intheir prayer: "Lord 
of the Universe! How long wilt thou sit upon 
(thy) Throne like a mourner in the days of 
his mourning with thy right hand behind 
thee 7and notV deliver thy children and 
reveal thy Kingdom in the world? And for 
how long wilt thou have no pity upon thy 
children who are made slaves among the 
nations of the world? Nor upon thy right 
hand that is behind thee wherewith thou 
didst stretch out the heavens and the earth 
and the heavens of heavens? When wilt thou 
have compassion?" 

(8) Then the Holy One, blessed be He, 
answered every one of them, saying: "Since 
these wicked do sin so and so, and 
transgress with such and such transgressions 
against me, how could I deliver my 

great Right Hand in the downfall by their 
hands (caused by them). 

(9) In that moment Metatron called me and 
spake to me: "My servant! Take the books, 
and read their evil doings!" Forthwith I took 
the books and read their doings and there 
were to be found 36 transgressions (written 
down) with regard to each wicked one and 
besides, that they have transgressed all the 
letters in the Tora, as it is written (Dan. ix. 
u) : "Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy 
Law". It is not written 'al torateka but 'et 
(JIN) torateka, for they have transgressed 
from 'Aleph to Taw, 40 statutes have they 
transgressed for each letter. 

(10) Forthwith Abraham, Isaac and Jacob 
wept. Then said to them the Holy One, 
blessed be He: "Abraham, my beloved, 
Isaac, my Elect one, Jacob, my firstborn! 



108 



How can I now deliver them from among 
the nations of the world?" And forthwith 
MIKAEL, the Prince of Israel, cried and 
wept with a loud voice and said (Ps. x. i) : 
"Why standest thou afar off, O Lord?". 



CHAPTER XLV 
Metatron shows R. Ishmael past 

andfuture events 

recorded on the Curtain of the 

Throne 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: 

(1) Come, and I will show thee the Curtain 
of MAQOM (the Divine Majesty) which is 
spread before the Holy One, blessed be He, 
(and) whereon are graven all the generations 
of the world and all their doings, both what 
they have done and what they will do until 
the end of all generations. 

(2) And I went, and he showed it to me 
pointing it out with his fingers Mike a father 
who teaches his children the letters of Tora. 
And I saw each generation, 

the rulers of each generation, 
and the heads of each generation, 
the shepherds of each generation, 
the oppressors (drivers) of each generation, 
the keepers of each generation, 
the scourgers of each generation, 
the overseers of each generation, 
the judges of each generation, 
the court officers of each generation , 
the teachers of each generation, 
the supporters of each generation, 
the chiefs of each generation, 
the presidents of academies of each 
generation, 

the magistrates of each generation, 
the princes of each generation, 
the counsellors of each generation, 
the nobles of each generation, 
and the men of might of each generation, 
the elders of each generation, 
and the guides of each generation. 

(3) And I saw Adam, his generation, their 
doings and their thoughts,Noah and his 
generation, their doings and their thoughts. 



and the generation of the flood, their doings 
and their thoughts, Shem and his generation, 
their doings and their thoughts, Nimrod and 
the generation of the confusion of tongues,

works and doings, Joshua and his 
generation, their works and doings, the 
judges and their generation, their works and 
doings, Eli and his generation, their works 
and doings, "Phinehas, their works and 
doings, Elkanah and his generation, their 
works and their doings, Samuel and his 
generation, their works and doings, the kings 
of Judah with their generations, their works 
and their doings, the kings of Israel and their 
generations, their works and their doings, 
the princes of Israel, their works and their 
doings; the princes of the nations of the 
world, their works and their doings, the 
heads of the councils of Israel, their works 
and their doings ; the heads of (the councils 
in) the nations of the world, their 
generations, their works and their doings; 
the rulers of Israel and their generation, their 
works and their doings ; the nobles of Israel 
and their generation, their works and their 
doings ; the nobles of the nations of the 
world and their generation(s), their works 
and their doings; the men of reputation in 
Israel, their generation, their works and their 
doings ; the judges of Israel, their 
generation, their works and their doings ; the 
judges of the nations of the world and their 
generation, their works and their doings ; the 
teachers of children in Israel, their 
generations, their works and their doings ; 
the teachers of children in the nations of the 
world, their generations, their works and 



109 



their doings; the counsellors (interpreters) of 
Israel, their generation, their works and their 
doings ; the counsellors (interpreters) of the 
nations of the world, their generation, their 
works and their doings ; all the prophets of 
Israel, their generation, their works and their 
doings ; all the prophets of the nations of the 
world, their generation, their works and their 
doings ; 

(5) and all the fights and wars that the 
nations 16 of the world wrought against the 
people of Israel in the time of their kingdom. 
And I saw Messiah, son of Joseph, and his 
generation "and their" works and their 
doings that they will do against the nations 
of the world. And I saw Messiah, son of 
David, and his generation, and all the fights 
and wars, and their works and their doings 
that they will do with Israel both for good 
and evil. And I saw all the fights and wars 
that Gog and Magog will fight in the days of 
Messiah, and all that the Holy One, blessed 
be He, will do with them in the time to 
come. 

(6)And all the rest of all the leaders of the 
generations and all the works of the 
generations both in Israel and in the nations 
of the world, both what is done and what 
will be done hereafter to all generations until 
the end of time, (all) were graven on the 
Curtain of MAQOM. And I saw all these 
things with my eyes; and after I had seen it, 
I opened my mouth in praise of MAQOM 
(the Divine Majesty) (saying thus, Eccl. viii. 
4, 5): "For the King's word hath power (and 
who may say unto him: What doest thou?) 
Whoso keepeth the commandments shall 
know no evil thing". And I said: 
(Ps. civ. 24) "O Lord, how manifold are thy 
works!". 



by night in fear of the Almighty (MAQOM) 
and (I will show thee) where they go and 
where they stand. 

(2) I walked by his side, and he took me by 
his hand and pointed out all to me with his 
fingers. And they were standing on sparks of 
flames round the Merkaba of the Almighty 
(MAQOM). What did Metatron do? At that 
moment he clapped his hands and chased 
them off from their place. Forthwith they 
flew off on flaming wings, rose and fled 
from the four sides of the Throne of the 
Merkaba, and (as they flew) he told me the 
names of every single one. As it is written 
(Ps. cxlvii. 4) :" He telleth the number of the 
stars ; he giveth them all their names", 
teaching, that the Holy One, blessed be He, 
has given a name to each one of them. 

(3) And they all enter in counted order under 
the guidance of (lit. through, by the hands 
of) RAHATIEL to Raqia' ha-shSHamayim 
to serve the world. And they go out in 
counted order to praise the Holy One, 
blessed be He, with songs and hymns, 
according as it is written (Ps. xix. i): "The 
heavens declare the glory of God". 

(4) But in the time to come the Holy One, 
blessed be He, will create them anew, as it is 
written (Lam. iii. 23): "They are new every 
morning". And they open their mouth and 
utter a song. 

Which is the song that they utter? (Ps. viii. 
3): "When I consider thy heavens". 



CHAPTER XL VII 

Metatron shows R. Ishmael the 

spirits 

of the punished angels 



CHAPTER XL VI 

The place of the stars shown to R. 

Ishmael 



R. Ishmael said : Metatron said to me : 

(1) (Come and I will show thee) the space of 
the stars a that are standing in Raqia' night 



R. Ishmael said: Metatron said to me: 

(1) Come and I will show thee the souls of 
the angels and the spirits of the ministering 
servants whose bodies have been burnt in 
the fire of MAQOM (the Almighty) that 
goes forth from his little finger. And they 
have been made into fiery coals in the midst 
of the fiery river (Nehar di-Nur). But their 
spirits and their souls are standing behind 
the Shekina. 



110 



(2) Whenever the ministering angels utter a 
song at a wrong timeor as not appointed to 
be sung they are burnt and consumed by the 
fire of their Creator and by a flame from 
their Maker, in the places (chambers) of the 
whirlwind, for it blows upon them and 
drives them into the Nehar di-Nur; and there 
they are made into numerous mountains of 
burning coal. But their spirit and their soul 
return to their Creator, and all are standing 
behind their Master. 

(3) And I went by his side and he took me 
by his hand ; and he showed me all the souls 
of the angels and the spirits of the 
ministering servants who were standing 
behind the Shekina upon wings of the 
whirlwind and walls of fire surrounding 
them. 

(4) At that moment Metatron opened to me 
the gates of the walls within which they 
were standing behind the Shekina, And I 
lifted up my eyes and saw them, and behold, 
the likeness of every one was as (that of) 
angels and their wings like birds' (wings), 
made out of flames, the work of burning 
fire. In that moment I opened my mouth in 
praise of MAQOM and said (Ps. xcii. 5): 
"How great are 

thy works, O Lord ". 



CHAPTER XL VIII (A) 
Metatron shows R. Ishmael the 

Right Hand of the 

Most High, now inactive behind 

Him, but in the 

future destined to work the 

deliverance of Israel 



R. Ishmael said : Metatron said to me : 

(1) Come, and I will show thee the Right 
Hand of MAQOM, laid behind (Him) 
because of the destruction of the Holy 
Temple ; from which all kinds of splendour 
and light shine forth and by which the 955 
heavens were created ; and whom not even 
the Seraphim and the 'Ophannim are 
permitted (to behold), until the day of 
salvation shall arrive. 



(2) And I went by his side and he took me 
by his hand and showed 
me (the Right Hand of MAQOM), with all 
manner of praise, rejoicing and song: and no 
mouth can tell its praise, and no eye can 
behold it, because of its greatness, dignity, 
majesty, glory and beauty. 
(3)And not only that, but all the souls of the 
righteous who are counted worthy to behold 
the joy of Jerusalem, they are standing by it, 
praising and praying before it three times 
every day, saying (Is.li.9): "Awake, awake, 
put on strength, O arm of the Lord" 
according as it is written (Is. Ixiii. 12): "He 
caused his glorious arm to go at the right 
hand of Moses". 

(4) In that moment the Right Hand of 
MAQOM was weeping. And there went 
forth from its five fingers five rivers of tears 
and fell down into the great sea and shook 
the whole world, according as it is written 
(Is. xxiv. 19, 20): "The earth is utterly 
broken (1), the earth is clean dissolved (2), 
the earth is moved exceedingly (3), the earth 
shall stagger like a drunken man (4) and 
shall be moved to and fro like a hut (5)", 
five times corresponding to the fingers of his 
Great Right Hand. 

(5) But when the Holy One, blessed be He, 
sees, that there is no righteous man in the 
generation, and no pious man (Chasid] on 
earth, and no justice in the hands of men ; 
and (that there is) no man like unto Moses, 
and no intercessor as Samuel who could 
pray before MAQOM for the salvation and 
for the deliverance, and for His Kingdom, 
that it be revealed in the whole world; and 
for His great Right Hand that He put it 
before Himself again to work great salvation 
by it for Israel, 

(6) then forthwith will the Holy One, blessed 
be He, remember His own justice, favour, 
mercy and grace : and He will deliver His 
great Arm by himself, and His righteousness 
will support Him. According as it is written 
(Is. lix. 16): "And he saw, that there was no 
man" (that is:) like unto Moses who prayed 
countless times for Israel in the desert and 
averted the (Divine) decrees from them" and 
he wondered, that there was no intercessor" 
like unto Samuel who intreated the Holy 
One, blessed be He, and called unto Him 



111 



and he answered him and fulfilled his desire, 
even if it was not fit (in accordance with the 
Divine plan), according as it is written (i 
Sam. xii. 17) : "Is it not wheat-harvest to- 
day? I will call unto the Lord". 

(7) And not only that, but He joined 
fellowship with Moses in every place, as it 
is written (Ps.xcix.6): "Moses and Aaron 
among His priests." And again it is written 
(Jer. XV. i): "Though Moses and Samuel 
stood before me" (Is. Ixiii. 5): "Mine own 
arm brought salvation unto me". 

(8) Said the Holy One, blessed be He in that 
hour: " How long shall I wait for the 
children of men to work salvation according 
to their righteousness for my arm? For my 
own sake and for the sake of my merit and 
righteousness will I deliver my arm and by it 
redeem my children from among the nations 
of the world. 

As it is written (Is. xlviii. n): "For my own 
sake will I do it. For how should my name 
be profaned". 

(9) In that moment will the Holy One, 
blessed be He, reveal His Great Arm and 
show it to the nations of the world: for its 
length is as the length of the world and its 
breadth is as the width of the 

world. And the appearance of its splendour 
is like unto the splendour of the sunshine in 
its might, in the summer solstice. 

(10) Forthwith Israel will be saved from 
among the nations of the world. And 
Messiah will appear unto them and He will 
bring them up to Jerusalem with great joy. 
And not only that but Israel will come from 
the four quarters of the World and eat with 
Messiah. But the nations of the world shall 
not eat with them, as it is written (Is. Hi. 
10): "The Lord hath made bare his holy arm 
in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the 
ends of the earth shall see the salvation of 
our God". And again (Deut. xxxii. 12): "The 
Lord alone did lead him, and there was no 
strange god with him". (Zech. xiv. 9) : "And 
the Lord shall be king over all the earth".

and lightning and their light is as lightnings 
of light and with the likeness of the 
chashmal. 

(2) And they give glory unto them and they 
answer and cry before them: Holy, Holy, 
Holy. 



112 



And they roll (convoy) them through every 
heaven as mighty and honoured princes. 
And when they bring them all back to the 
place of the Throne of Glory, then all the 
Chayyoth by the Merkaba open their mouth 
in praise of His glorious name, saying: 
"Blessed be the name of His glorious 
kingdom for ever and ever". 



(5) The height of his stature among all those 
(that are) of high stature (is) seventy 
thousand parasangs. And I made his glory 
great as the majesty of my glory. 

(6) and the brilliance of his eyes as the 
splendour of the Throne of Glory. 

(7) his garment honour and majesty, his 
royal crown 500 by 500 parasangs. 



CHAPTER XL VIII (cont.) (c) 
An Enoch-Metatron piece 

ALT 1 

(1) "I seized him, and I took him and I 
appointed him" that is Enoch, the son of 
Jared, whose name is Metatron 

(2) and I took him from among the children 
of men 

(5) and made him a Throne over against my 
Throne. Which is the size of that Throne? 
Seventy thousand parasangs (all) of fire. 
(9) I committed unto him 70 angels 
corresponding to the nations (of the world) 
and I gave into his charge all the household 
above and below. 

(7) And I committed to him Wisdom and 
Intelligence more than (to) all the angels. 
And I called his name "the LESSER YAH", 
whose name is by Gematria 71. And I 
arranged for him all the works of Creation. 
And I made his power to transcend (lit. I 
made for him power more than) all the 
ministering angels. 

ALT 2 

(3) He committed unto Metatron that is 
Enoch, the son of Jared all treasuries. And I 
appointed him 

over all the stores that I have in every 
heaven. And I committed into his hands the 
keys of each heavenly store. 

(4) I made (of) him the prince over all the 
princes, and I made (of) him a minister of 
my Throne of Glory, to provide for and 
arrange the Holy Chayyoth, to wreathe 
crowns for them (to crown them with 
crowns), to clothe them with honour and 
majesty to prepare for them a seat when he 
is 

sitting on his throne to magnify his glory in 
the height. 



ALT 3 

(1) Alephl I made him strong, I took him, I 
appointed him; (namely) Metatron, my 
servant who is one (unique) among all the 
children of heaven. I made him strong in the 
generation of the first Adam. But when I 
beheld the men of the generation of the 
flood, that they were corrupt, then I went 
and removed my Shekina from among them. 
And 1 lifted it up on high with the sound of 
a trumpet and with a shout, as it is written 
(Ps.xlvii. 6): "God is gone up with a shout, 
the Lord with the sound of a trumpet". 

(2) "And I took him": (that is) Enoch, the 
son of Jared, from among them. And I lifted 
him up with the sound of a trumpet and with 
a tera'a (shout) to the high heavens, to be my 
witness together with the Chayyoth by the 
Merkaba in the world to come. 

(3) I appointed him over all the treasuries 
and stores that I have in every heaven. And I 
committed into his hand the keys of every 
several one. 

(4) I made (of) him the prince over all the 
princes and a minister of the Throne of 
Glory (and) the Halls of Araboth: to open 
their doors to me, and (of) the Throne of 
Glory, to exalt an arrange it; (and I 
appointed him over) the Holy Chayyot to 
wreathe crowns upon their heads; the 
majestic 'Ophannim, to crown them with 
strength and glory; the; honoured Kerubim, 
to clothe: them in majesty; over the radiant 
sparks, to make them to shine with 
splendour and brilliance; over the flaming 
Seraphim, to cover them with highness; the 
Chashmallim of light, to make them radiant 
with Light and to prepare the seat for me 
every morning as I sit upon the Throne of 
Glory. And to extol and magnify my glory 
inthe height of my power; (and I have 



113 



committed unto him) the secrets of above 
and the secrets of below (heavenly secrets 
and earthly secrets). 

(5) I made him higher than all. The height of 
his stature, in the midst of all (who are) high 
of stature (I made) seventy thousand 
parasangs. I made his Throne great by the 
majesty of my Throne. And I increased its 
glory by the honour of my glory. 

(6) I transformed his flesh into torches of 
fire, and all the bones of his body into fiery 
coals; and I made the appearance of his eyes 
as the lightning, and the light of his 
eyebrows as the imperishable light. I made 
his face bright as the splendour of the sun, 
and his eyes as the splendour of the Throne 
of Glory. 

(7) I made honour and majesty his clothing, 
beauty and highness his covering cloak and 
a royal crown of 500 by (times) 500 
parasangs (his) diadem. And I put upon him 
of my honour, my majesty and the 
splendour, of my glory that is upon my 
Throne of Glory. I called him the LESSER 
YHWH, the Prince of the Presence, the 
Knower of Secrets: for every secret did I 
reveal to him as a father and all mysteries 
declared I unto him in uprightness. 

(8) I set up his throne at the door of my Hall 
that he may sit and judge the heavenly 
household on high. And I placed every 
prince before him, to receive authority from 
him, to perform his will. 

(9) Seventy names did I take from (my) 
names and called him by them to enhance 
his glory. 

Seventy princes gave I into his hand, to 
command unto them my precepts and my 
words in every language: 

to abase by his word the proud to the 
ground, and to exalt by the utterance of his 
lips the humble to the height ; to smite kings 
by his speech, to turn kings away from their 
paths, to set up(the) rulers over their 
dominion as it is written (Dan.ii. 21): "and 
he changeth the times and the seasons, and 
to give wisdom unto all the setwise of the 
world and understanding (and) knowledge to 
all who understand knowledge, as it is griten 
(Dan. ii. 21): " and knowledge to them that 
know understanding", to reveal to them the 



secrets of my words and to teach the decree 
of my righteous judgement, 
(10) as it is written (Is.Iv. n): "so shall my 
word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it 
shall not return unto me void but shall 
accomplish (that which I please)". 'E'eseh' 
(I shall accomplish) is not written here, but 
"asdh' (he shall accomplish), meaning, that 
whatever word and whatever utterance goes 
forth from before the Holy One, blessed be 
He, Metatron stands and carries it out. And 
he establishes the decrees of the Holy One, 
blessed be He. 



CHAPTER XLVIII (D) 

The names of Metatron. The 

treasuries of Wisdom opened to 

Moses on mount Sinai. The angels 

protest against Metatron for 
reveaUng the secrets to Moses and 

are answered and rebuked by 

God. The chain of tradition and the 

power of the transmitted 

mysteries to heal diseases 

(1) Seventy names has Metatron which the 
Holy One, blessed be He, took from his own 
name and put upon him. And these they are: 
YeHOEL, YaH, YeHOEL, YOPHIEL and 
Yophphiel, and 'APHPHIEL and 
MaRGeZIEL, GIPpUYEL, Pa'aZIEL, 'A'aH, 
PeRIEL, TaTRIEL, TaBKIEL,'W, YHWH,

YaHSeYaH, SSBIBYaH, SaBKaSBeYaH,

QaMYaH, MeKaPpeRYaH, PeRISHYaH, 
SePhaM, GBIR, GiBbORYaH, GOR, 
GORYaH, ZIW, 'OKBaR, the LESSER 
YHWH, after the name of his Master, (Ex. 
xxiii. 21) "for my name is in him", 
RaBIBIEL, TUMIEL, Segansakkiel 
('Sagnezagiel' / 'Neganzegael), the Prince of 
Wisdom. 

(2) And why is he called by the name 
Sagnesakiel? Because all the treasuries of 
wisdom are committed in his hand. 

(3) And all of them were opened to Moses 
on Sinai, so that he learnt them during the 
forty days, while he was standing 
(remaining}: the Torah in the seventy 
aspects of the seventy tongues, the Prophets 
in the seventy aspects of the seventy 
tongues, the Writings in the seventy aspects 
of the seventy tongues, "the Halakas in the 
seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the 
Traditions in the seventy aspects of the 
seventy tongues, the Haggadas in the 
seventy aspects of the seventy tongues and 
the Toseftas in the seventy aspects of the 
seventy tongues'. 

(4) But as soon as the forty days were ended, 
he forgot all of them in one moment. Then 
the Holy One, blessed be He, called 
Yephiphyah, the Prince of the Law, and 
(through him) they were given to Moses as a 
gift. As it is written (Deut. x. 4): "and the 
Lord gave them unto me". And after that it 
remained with him. And whence do we 
know, that it remained (in his memory) ? 
Because it is written (Mai. iv. 4): " 
Remember ye the Law of Moses my servant 
which I commanded unto him in Horeb for 
all Israel, even my statutes and judgements". 
The Law of Moses': that is the Tora, the 
Prophets and the Writings, 'statutes': that is 
the Halakas and Traditions, 'judgements'; 
that is the Haggadas and the Toseftas. And 
all of them were given to Moses on high on 
Sinai. 

(5) These seventy names (are) a reflection of 
the Explicit Name(s) on the Merkaba which 



are graven upon the Throne of Glory. For 
the Holy One, blessed be He, took from His 
Explicit Name(s) and put upon the name of 
Metatron: Seventy Names of His by which 
the ministering angels call the King of the 
kings of kings, blessed be He, in the high 
heavens, and twenty-two letters that are on 
the ring upon his finger with which are 
sealed the destinies of the princes of 
kingdoms on high in greatness and power 
and with which are sealed the lots of the 
Angel of Death, and the destinies of every 
nation and tongue. 

(6) Said Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of 
the Presence; the Angel, the Prince of the 
Wisdom; the Angel, the Prince of the 
Understanding; the Angel, the Prince of the 
Kings; the Angel, the Prince of the Rulers; 
the angel, the Prince of the Glory; the angel, 
the Prince of the high ones, and of the 
princes, the exalted, great and honoured 
ones, in heaven and on earth: 

(7) "H, the God of Israel, is my witness in 
this thing, (that] when I revealed this secret 
to Moses, then all the hosts in every heaven 
on high raged against me and said to me: 

(8) Why dost thou reveal this secret to son 
of man, born of woman, tainted and unclean, 
a man of a putrefying drop, the secret by 
which were created heaven and earth, the 
sea and the dry land, the mountains and 
hills, the rivers and springs, Gehenna of fire 
and hail, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of 
Life; and by which were formed Adam and 
Eve, and the cattle, and the wild beasts, and 
the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, 
and Behemoth and Leviathan, and the 
creeping things, the worms, the dragons of 
the sea, and the creeping things of the 
deserts; and the Tora and Wisdom and 
Knowledge and Thought and the Gnosis of 
things above and the fear of heaven. Why 
dost thou reveal this to flesh and blood? 

I answered them: Because the Holy One, 
blessed be He, has given me authority. And 
furthermore, I have obtained permission 
from the high and exalted Throne, from 
which all the Explicit Names go forth with 
lightnings of fire and flaming chashmallim. 

(9) But they were not appeased, until the 
Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them and 
drove them away with rebuke from before 



115 



him, saying to them: "I delight in, and have 
set my love on, and have entrasted and 
committed unto Metatron, my Servant, 
alone, for he is One (unique) among all the 
children of heaven. 

(10) And Metatron brought them out from 
his house of treasuries and committed them 
to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua 
to the elders, and the elders to the prophets 
and the prophets to the men of the Great 
Synagogue, and the men of the Great 
Synagogue to Ezra and Ezra the Scribe to 
Hillel the elder, and Hillel the elder to R. 
Abbahu and R. Abbahu to R. Zera, and R. 
Zera to the men of faith, and the men of 
faith (committed them) to give warning and 
to heal by them all diseases that rage in the 
world, as it is written (Ex. xv. 26): "If thou 
wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the 
Lord, thy God, and wilt do that which is 
right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his 
commandments, and keep all his statutes, I 
will put none of the diseases upon thee, 
which I have put upon the Egyptians : for I 
am the Lord, that healeth thee". 
(Ended and finished. Praise be unto the 
Creator of the World.)
