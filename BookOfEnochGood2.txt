Introduction
I have based this book on Michael A Knibb's scholarly translation of the
Ethiopian manuscripts, (The Ethiopic Book of Enoch, Oxford University
Press), which I believe to be the best translation currently available
I first heard about the Book of Enoch a few years ago, while I was
researching into ‘End of Days’ prophesies When I finally managed to get
hold of a copy, I discovered that it was a very strange and unusual book
The first time I read it I was skeptical and somewhat puzzled; I wondered
who would have written an odd book like this
I knew that Enoch, (Hanokh in Hebrew), was very favourably mentioned in
Genesis, and I discovered that Enoch’s book describes the Exodus and
Moses very favourably (although not by name)
So my first theory was that it might have been written around the same time
as the Torah, perhaps around 1400 BC However, after several readings I
could find no plausible theories The prophecy of the animals is extremely
precisely written and obviously refers to events well after Moses (see my
notes on that chapter) Additionally; who would have dared to produce a
book with people such as Moses described in terms of farm animals?
Michael Knibb, whose translation I have used to produce this book, studied
all available manuscripts and sources, and it is clear that this book was well
known and studied in many countries well before the time of Jesus The
earliest known surviving fragments and quotations in various languages
show that this is the same book, and that the Ethiopians have preserved it well
In the end I was convinced that the book is really Enoch’s true account of
otherwise forgotten events that occurred in early times; events that we have
no other surviving records of
Enoch left us a book that describes people of an advanced culture; blonde
haired people that Enoch’s people considered to be Angels of God, and it
was written on the angels’ instruction
The standard academic view seems to be that some slightly demented
religious fanatic wrote the book - not long before the earliest provable
fragments, (200 or 300BC) I think it is impossible to support this view
Such an author would have to be able to write the entire book from the
point of view of a person who knows nothing of countries with names, or
religions with names Then he goes on to describe the Angels as blond
men, who ran away from Heaven in order to be promiscuous with women
I don’t believe this is the sort of world view that would have been well
received or widely accepted anywhere in 200 BC This plus the all too
accurate prophecies are probably the reasons why it was ‘lost’ by the
religions that used to regard it as holy
I concluded that the book is probably what it appears to be; well preserved,
ancient and genuine Enoch was the great-grandfather of Noah, and father
of Methuselah, and his book gives a unique view of the world before the
flood; which recent research suggests may have occurred as long ago as
17,000 BC
The History of the Book of Enoch
The book was thought to have been lost, for over 2,000 years, with many
ancient sources referring to it, and even quoting parts, but no complete
copies were known Then in 1773, James Bruce brought three copies back
from Ethiopia, having spent some years exploring the country
Enoch had two main reasons for writing his book The first was because
the Watchers instructed him to do it, (see section 15 at 815 and 816) The
second reason; was to save his family from the flood
Enoch wrote his book, after his grandson Lamech was born, but before
Noah was born Noah is only named in the section that Methuselah wrote,
(see section 10 at 1073), and of course in his own section (section 11, The
Book of Noah) So, there may still have been 40 - 80 years left before the
flood, at the time when Enoch wrote his book
There is a long gap between the time of the flood and the time when Moses
gave praise to Enoch in Genesis Genesis dates from around 1400 BC, and
forms part of the Torah (the first five books of the bible)
In Genesis, there is Enoch's family; as named by him in this book, and a
quick recap of some of Enoch's story
It seems likely therefore, that copies of the Book of Enoch survived into
Egyptian times, 3500 BC, and was known to Moses around 2,000 years later
Moses presumably took a copy of the book with him when they all left
Egypt, and he was no doubt pleased to see Enoch's prophecy fulfilled
The book probably existed mainly in Hebrew during the thousand years
after the exodus No Hebrew copies exist today, however, although there
are some Hebrew passages quoted in some of the Aramaic fragments that
survive from a few centuries BC
The appearance of the book in Ethiopia, is probably due to events in
Jerusalem during the reign of King Manasseh of Judah, (695 - 642 BC),
which are documented in the Bible, (Chronicles 33:1 - 20, and at Kings 21:1 – 18)
King Manasseh was not of the Jewish faith, he erected alters to Baal and
Asherah in Solomon's Temple In Kings at 21:16, it says that so much
innocent blood was shed that it filled Jerusalem from end to end At this
time, the religious establishment left the country, taking the Ark of the
Covenant and all the important religious texts with them
After a number of years in Egypt, the refugees went further south, near to
the source of the Nile, at Lake Tana in Ethiopia The descendants of these
people are the Falashas, who even today follow the form of Judaism that
had been practiced in Israel only before 620 BC The Ethiopians translated
The Book of Hanokh into Ge'ez, and had enough respect to look after it
Meanwhile, all Hebrew versions disappeared but a substantial part of the
book had survived in Greek, and some parts in Aramaic, but until Scottish
traveler, and freemason, James Bruce, returned from Ethiopia in 1773, with
three manuscripts, no one in the west had ever seen the whole book
The two commonly available translations were done soon after this and the
book was received with an embarrassed silence, for the most part, and not
widely read
This book is based on a new translation published in 1978, which was
produced as a result of research into a large number of the Ethiopian
manuscripts and a review of all other surviving fragments My hope is that
this present edition will be the best version of Enoch's book available in
English
I think this is an important book, and I have done my best to present it as
clearly as possible, and in a way that I hope Hanokh would have approved of condition of the Text
I believe the text to be in good condition generally It seems to be almost
complete, with a beginning and an end, and it is self-consistent Even more
significant is the way that Enoch's character and style of writing are still
apparent The only parts that I suspect were written by different authors I
have separated out, as the Book of Methuselah, and the Book of Noah, (chapters 10 & 11)
The translation by Michael Knibb, into English, is very good, and I have
had to do very little to the text in order to change it from a good translation
into clear English I have added quite a lot of punctuation and improved
the presentation, but I have made only very minor changes to the text (such
as substituting ‘before’ with ‘in front of’ where appropriate In a few
places I have substituted “sky” for Heaven where it makes the meaning
clearer Where Enoch says “the face of Heaven” he means the sky but I
have left it unchanged I only changed Heaven to sky where I was sure that
was the intended meaning Similarly, I have tried to use Earth with a
capital where I think the meaning is the whole planet and earth, without a
capital, where the meaning may just be the ground – which Enoch often
differentiates himself by referring to “the dry ground” rather than “the earth”
Fortunately, Enoch's style was to use a simple vocabulary, and he assumed
no pre-knowledge by the reader Anything complicated, he explains at
length, with quite a lot of repetition
This has helped to preserve the book through many translations There are
a few places, even so, where there are problems I have marked these with
dots () where some words seem to have been lost Fortunately, there are
not many of these, and nothing important appears to be missing.
I did find a few translocations in the text:
• Methuselah's book had been inserted near the back,
• Noah's book and ‘The Storehouses’ had been inserted into the Third Parable
• Part of the Prophecy of the Ten weeks was in the wrong order
I have kept the Ethiopian ‘chapter and verse’ numbers, in all cases, so that
my changes to the order of presentation can easily be seen
I have split the book into sections - where there seems to be a natural break, and given each one a title
I inserted Noah and Methuselah’s works into the middle - where there
seems to be a major break in Enoch’s book The first section of Enoch is
mainly the story of what occurred whereas the second part is mainly written
from the notes that Enoch took while he was with the Watchers
Additionally, the end of Noah’s short book conveniently serves as an
introduction to Enoch’s Book of Parables

The Book of Enoch 
Notes Start: (1) THE BLESSING OF ENOCH (page 11)
This section is Enoch's introduction to the book At 12, he explains how the angels
(Watchers) showed him a vision of the future At 15, the Watchers are mentioned; here
Enoch means the run-away rebel Watchers who came to live in his area (this is described in section 3)
In the bible (Gen 64), the descendants of the Watchers are described as giants or
Nephilim, they may have been bigger than the local people, Enoch describes them as
giants, 72, Andrew Collins' investigations suggest that a race of unusually large people
did once exist (See his book From the Ashes of Angels)
The main theme is that of destruction; God is going to clear away the sinners, so that
good people can have peace This is the Flood of Noah which was still some way off
when Enoch wrote the book, although there are details of a ‘second end’ later in the
book (see the 10 weeks)
Notes End: (1) THE BLESSING OF ENOCH 
1) THE BLESSING OF ENOCH
11 These are the words of the blessing of Enoch; according to which he blessed the chosen and righteous who must be present on the day of distress, which is appointed, for the removal of all the wicked and impious
12 And Enoch began his story and said: There was a righteous man whose eyes were opened by the Lord, and he saw a Holy vision in the Heavens, which the Angels showed to me And I heard everything from them, and I understood what I saw: but not for this generation, but for a distant generation that will come
13 Concerning the Chosen I spoke; and I uttered a parable concerning them: The Holy and Great One will come out of his dwelling
14 And the Eternal God will tread from there upon Mount Sinai, and he will appear with his Host, and will appear in the strength of his power from Heaven
15 And all will be afraid, and the Watchers will shake, and fear and great trembling will seize them, up to the ends of the earth
16 And the high mountains will be shaken; and the high hills will be laid low and will melt like wax in a flame
17 And the earth will sink, and everything that is on the earth will be destroyed, and there will be judgment upon all, and upon all the righteous
18 But for the righteous: He will make peace, and He will keep safe the Chosen, and mercy will be upon them They will all belong to God, and will prosper and be blessed, and the light of God will shine on them
19 And behold! He comes with ten thousand Holy Ones; to execute judgment upon them and to destroy the impious, and to contend with all flesh concerning everything that the sinners and the impious have done and wrought against Him
20) GOD'S LAWS
21 Contemplate all the events in the sky; how the lights in the sky do not change their courses, how each rises and sets in order, each at its proper time, and they do not transgress their law
22 Consider the earth and understand from the work that is done upon it, from the beginning to the end, that no work of God changes as it becomes manifest
23 Consider the summer and the winter; how the whole earth is full of water and the clouds and dew and rain rest upon it
31 Contemplate and see how all the trees appear withered and all their leaves are stripped - with the exception of the fourteen trees, which are not stripped, which remain with the old leaves until the new come after two or three years
41 And, again, contemplate the days of summer; how at its beginning the Sun is above it You seek shelter and shade because of the heat of the Sun and the earth burns with scorching heat, and you cannot tread upon the earth or upon a rock, because of its heat
51 Contemplate how the trees are covered with green leaves and bear fruit And understand, in respect of everything, and perceive how He Who Lives Forever made all these things for you
52 And how His works are before Him in each succeeding year, and all His works serve Him and do not change; but as God has decreed - so everything is done
53 And consider how the seas and rivers together complete their tasks
54 But you have not persevered in, nor observed, the Law of the Lord But you have transgressed and have spoken proud and hard words with your unclean mouth against his majesty You hard of heart! You will not have peace!
55 And because of this you will curse your days, and the years of your life you will destroy And the eternal curse will increase and you will not receive mercy
56 In those days, you will transform your name into an eternal curse to all the righteous And they will curse you sinners forever
57 For the chosen; there will be light, joy, and peace, and they will inherit the earth But for you, the impious, there will be a curse
58 When wisdom is given to the chosen they will all live, and will not again do wrong, either through forgetfulness, or through pride But those who possess wisdom will be humble
59 They will not again do wrong, and they will not be judged in all the days of their life, and they will not die of wrath or anger But they will complete the number of the days of their life And their life will grow in peace, and the years of their joy will increase in gladness and eternal peace; all the days of their life
Notes Start: (3) REBELS AMONG THE WATCHERS (pages 15-17)
This is the story of the fallen angels The beginning, 61-2, is virtually identical
with Genesis 61-2 In Enoch's book, we get their names and many other details
At 66, Enoch explains the naming of Mount Hermon - in Hebrew it means
curses The mountain that he was actually referring to is possibly somewhere near Lake
Van in Turkey It is common for translators to update names rather than use phonetics,
so the few names that appear, mainly mountains and rivers, can’t be relied upon as
accurate identifications We don’t know whether there was another mountain called
‘curses’ or even what language the book was originally written in
At 72, he says they had giant sons I believe that this means, not that they were
physically big, but powerful and wealthy with private armies Nevertheless, the
Watchers may have been larger than the local people were Many years of advanced
healthcare and nutrition can lead to increasing average size
They were probably quite young, these runaway angels, but they had weapons
and knowledge (81) that meant they were able to dominate Enoch's people easily
Since they could have children, by women, I think it is safe to assume that they
are men, and not angels (or any other non-human entity), since breeding is species
specific by definition They were regarded as angels by Enoch and his people, (see
what Lamech says at 1065-6 in section 10), but Enoch also says they could appear like
men when they wished, (see 171), but even so, he never seems to doubt their divinity
At 84, the scene switches: to the angels in heaven - the Watchers at their home
base The activities of the runaways cause them to be noticed
This section ends with some of the Watchers asking their Headman what should
they do about the runaways Alternatively, it could be seen as God being informed that
no souls wish to incarnate on the Earth because conditions are becoming so bad

3) REBELS AMONG THE WATCHERS
61 And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those days there were born to them fair and beautiful daughters
62 And the Angels, the sons of Heaven, saw them and desired them And they said to one another: "Come, let us choose for ourselves wives, from the children of men, and let us beget, for ourselves, children"
63 And Semyaza, who was their leader, said to them: "I fear that you may not wish this deed to be done and that I alone will pay for this great sin"
64 And they all answered him, and said: "Let us all swear an oath, and bind one-another with curses, so not to alter this plan, but to carry out this plan effectively"
65 Then they all swore together and all bound one another with curses to it
66 And they were, in all, two hundred and they came down on Ardis, which is the summit of Mount Hermon And they called the mountain Hermon because on it they swore and bound one another with curses
67 And these are the names of their leaders: Semyaza, who was their leader, Urakiba, Ramiel, Kokabiel, Tamiel, Ramiel, Daniel, Ezeqiel, Baraqiel, Asael, Armaros, Ananel, Zaqiel, Samsiel, Satael, Turiel, Yomiel, Araziel 
68 These are the leaders of the two hundred Angels and of all the others with them
71 And they took wives for themselves and everyone chose for himself one each And they began to go into them and were promiscuous with them And they taught them charms and spells, and they showed them the cutting of roots and trees
72 And they became pregnant and bore large giants And their height was three thousand cubits
73 These devoured all the toil of men; until men were unable to sustain them
74 And the giants turned against them in order to devour men
75 And they began to sin against birds, and against animals, and against reptiles, and against fish, and they devoured one another's flesh, and drank the blood from it
76 Then the Earth complained about the lawless ones
81 And Azazel taught men to make swords, and daggers, and shields, and breastplates And he showed them the things after these, and the art of making them; bracelets, and ornaments, and the art of making up the eyes, and of beautifying the eyelids, and the most precious stones, and all kinds of coloured dyes And the world was changed
82 And there was great impiety, and much fornication, and they went astray, and all their ways became corrupt
83 Amezarak taught all those who cast spells and cut roots, Armaros the release of spells, and Baraqiel astrologers, and Kokabiel portents, and Tamiel taught astrology, and Asradel taught the path of the Moon
84 And at the destruction of men they cried out; and their voices reached Heaven
91 And then Michael, Gabriel, Suriel and Uriel, looked down from Heaven and saw the mass of blood that was being shed on the earth and all the iniquity that was being done on the earth
92 And they said to one another: "Let the devastated Earth cry out with the sound of their cries, up to the Gate of Heaven
93 And now to you, Oh Holy Ones of Heaven, the souls of men complain, saying: "Bring our complaint before the Most High"
94 And they said to their Lord, the King: "Lord of Lords, God of Gods, King of Kings! Your glorious throne endures for all the generations of the world, and blessed and praised!
95 You have made everything, and power over everything is yours And everything is uncovered, and open, in front of you, and you see everything, and there is nothing that can be hidden from you
96 See then what Azazel has done; how he has taught all iniquity on the earth and revealed the eternal secrets that are made in Heaven
97 And Semyaza has made known spells, he to whom you gave authority to rule over those who are with him
98 And they went into the daughters of men together, lay with those women, became unclean, and revealed to them these sins
99 And the women bore giants, and thereby the whole Earth has been filled with blood and iniquity, And now behold the souls which have died cry out and complain unto the Gate of Heaven, and their lament has ascended, and they cannot go out in the face of the iniquity which is being committed on the earth 
100 And you know everything, before it happens, and you know this, and what concerns each of them But you say nothing to us What ought we to do with them, about this?"
Notes Start: (4) THE MOST HIGH OF THE WATCHERS SPEAKS OUT (Pages 19–21)
Enoch presents us with a condemnation of the runaways by the Most High of the
Watchers This section shows how the runaways are regarded at home
Some background details do emerge later in the book At 10613 (section 10),
we learn that the runaways came to Enoch's area in his father's day Enoch is a scribe,
see 124, and he says that it was the angels who introduced writing So, Enoch was
probably taught to write, and employed, by the runaway angels
At 101-3, the Most High instructs an angel to save the son of Lamech (this will
be Noah) from the flood This is interesting, because besides prophesying details of the
flood, and its timing, it reveals that this was written at a time when Enoch is a
grandfather, (of Lamech), but he does not yet know what Lamech's son will be called
If the runaways were young in Enoch's father’s day, then they are probably at
least 10 years older than Enoch and maybe more So, it is likely that the events in this
book happen at a time when the runaways are quite old I have wondered if they (the
angels) lived longer than we would think was normal but there isn’t enough detail to draw a conclusion
The majority of this section consists of a prophecy of doom for the runaways:
They will see their families destroyed by fighting amongst themselves during their
lifetime They will suffer in the afterlife and the societies they founded will be wiped away by a flood
He says, at 122, that there will never again be another flood like the one to come
Notes End: (4) THE MOST HIGH OF THE WATCHERS SPEAKS OUT 
4) THE MOST HIGH OF THE WATCHERS SPEAKS OUT
1001 And then the Most High, the Great and Holy One, spoke and sent Arsyalalyur to the son of Lamech, and said to him:
1002 "Say to him in my name; hide yourself! And reveal to him the end, which is coming, because the whole earth will be destroyed A deluge is about to come on all the earth; and all that is in it will be destroyed
1003 And now teach him so that he may escape and his offspring may survive for the whole Earth"
1004 And further the Lord said to Raphael: "Bind Azazel by his hands and his feet and throw him into the darkness And split open the desert, which is in Dudael, and throw him there
1005 And throw on him jagged and sharp stones and cover him with darkness And let him stay there forever And cover his face so that he may not see the light
1006 And so that, on the Great Day of Judgment, he may be hurled into the fire
1007 And restore the Earth which the Angels have ruined And announce the restoration of the Earth For I shall restore the Earth so that not all the sons of men shall be destroyed because of the knowledge which the Watchers made known and taught to their sons
1008 And the whole Earth has been ruined by the teaching of the works of Azazel; and against him write: ALL SIN"
1009 And the Lord said to Gabriel: “Proceed against the bastards, and the reprobates, and against the sons of the fornicators And destroy the sons of the fornicators, and the sons of the Watchers, from amongst men And send them out, and send them against one another, and let them destroy themselves in battle; for they will not have length of days
1010 And they will petition you, but the petitioners will gain nothing in respect of them, for they hope for eternal life, and that each of them will live life for five hundred years"
1011 And the Lord said to Michael: "Go, inform Semyaza, and the others with him, who have associated with the women to corrupt themselves with them in all their uncleanness
1012 When all their sons kill each other, and when they see the destruction of their loved ones, bind them for seventy generations, under the hills of the earth, until the day of their judgment and of their consummation, until the judgment, which is for all eternity, is accomplished
1013 And in those days, they will lead them to the Abyss of Fire; in mtorment, and in prison they will be shut up for all eternity
1014 And then Semyaza will be burnt, and from then on destroyed with them; together they will be bound until the end of all generations
1015 And destroy all the souls of lust, and the sons of the Watchers, for they have wronged men
1016 Destroy all wrong from the face of the Earth and every evil work will cease
1017 And now all the righteous will be humble, and will live until they beget thousands And all the days of their youth, and their sabbaths, they will fulfill in peace
1018 And in those days the whole earth will be tilled in righteousness and all of it will be planted with trees; and it will be filled with blessing
1019 And all the pleasant trees they will plant on it and they will plant on it vines And the vine that is planted on it will produce fruit in abundance; and every seed that is sown on it, each measure will produce a thousand, and each measure of olives will produce ten baths of oil
1020 And you cleanse the Earth from all wrong, and from all iniquity, and from all sin, and from all impiety, and from all the uncleanness which is brought about on the earth
1021 And all the sons of men shall be righteous, and all the nations shall serve and bless me and all shall worship me
1022 And the Earth will be cleansed from all corruption, and from all sin, and from all wrath, and from all torment; and I will not again send a flood upon it, for all generations, forever
111 And in those days, I will open the Storehouses of Blessing, which are in Heaven, so that I may send them down upon the Earth, upon the work, and upon the toil, of the sons of men
112 Peace and truth will be united, for all the days of eternity, and for all the generations of eternity
Notes Start: (5) ENOCH MEETS THE HOLY WATCHERS (pages 23-24)
This section describes how Enoch became involved Enoch describes how
representatives of the Watchers approached him, while praying, (123) They gave him
a message to pass on to the runaways The message is outlined between 124 and 132
Enoch describes the terror among the runaways when they discover they have been
found
Enoch explains how the runaways decided to send a letter, (134-–6), begging
forgiveness, and Enoch is given the job of writing and delivering this letter
Enoch does not disclose the actual contents of their letter or much about how it
was delivered He says he went to the waters of Dan (Lake Van?) and read it out, and a
reply came to him in a dream, (137-8), but he also says at 121-2 that he had
disappeared because he was with the Watchers
Notes End: (5) ENOCH MEETS THE HOLY WATCHERS 
5) ENOCH MEETS THE HOLY WATCHERS
121 And then Enoch disappeared and none of the sons of men knew where he was hidden, where he was, or what had happened
122 And all his doings were with the Holy Ones, and with the Watchers, in his days
123 And I Enoch, was blessing the Great Lord and the King of Eternity And behold, the Watchers called to me - Enoch the scribe - and said to me:
124 "Enoch, scribe of righteousness Go and inform the Watchers of Heaven, who have left the High Heaven and the Holy Eternal Place, and have corrupted themselves with women, and have done as the sons of men do and have taken wives for themselves, and have become completely corrupt on the earth
125 They will have on Earth, neither peace, nor forgiveness of sin, for they will not rejoice in their sons
126 The slaughter of their beloved ones they will see; and over the destruction of their sons they will lament and petition forever But they will have neither mercy nor peace”
131 And Enoch went and said to Azazel: "You will not have peace A severe sentence has come out against you that you should be bound
132 And you will have neither rest nor mercy, nor the granting of any petitions, because of the wrong which you have taught, and because of all the works of blasphemy and wrong and sin which you have shown to the sons of men"
133 And then I went and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid; fear and trembling seized them
134 And they asked me to write out for them the record of a petition, so that they might receive forgiveness, and to take a record of their petition up to the Lord in Heaven
135 For they were not able, from then on, to speak, and they did not raise their eyes to Heaven, out of shame for the sins, for which they had been condemned
136 And then I wrote out the record of their petition, and their supplication in regard to their spirits, and the deeds of each one of them, and in regard to what they asked; that they should obtain absolution and forbearance 
137 And I went and sat down by the waters of Dan, in Dan, which is southwest of Hermon; and I read out the record of their petition, until I fell asleep
138 And behold a dream came to me, and visions fell upon me, and I saw a vision of wrath; that I should speak to the sons of Heaven and reprove them
139 And I woke up and went to them, and they were all sitting gathered together as they mourned, in Ubelseyael, which is between Lebanon and Senir, with their faces covered
1310 And I spoke in front of them all; the visions that I had seen in my sleep, and I began to speak these words to reprove the Watchers of Heaven
Notes Start: (6) THE BOOK OF REPROOF (pages 26-29)
This is the reply to the runaways' letter The judgment is outlined at 144-7
They are to be bound on earth, (145), this could mean endless reincarnation;
presumably they would know exactly what it meant At 146, the deaths of their sons, is
predicted again, and at 147, they are further criticized for the form of their petition
The section at 148 is interesting; here Enoch goes into more detail about how he
saw this vision It sounds to me, as though Enoch was taken in a vehicle that could fly!
(See also section 15 at 815, here three of the Watchers take Enoch home, and drop him
off outside his front door) From-149 - 151, Enoch describes his journey, and the place where he was
taken He was obviously very impressed and rather frightened The "wall of
hailstones" might be glass, and the "tongue of fire" could be artificial lighting
At 151, the Most High speaks to Enoch, and he mocks the runaways for sending
Enoch to carry their petition (152)
He goes on to explain the reasons for the harshness of the judgment At 163, he
criticizes them for leaving before they had completed their education He says that what
they knew was worthless, and that their lack of wisdom will lead to bad consequences

6) THE BOOK OF REPROOF
141 This book is the word of righteousness, and of reproof, for the Watchers who are from Eternity; as the Holy and Great One commanded in that vision
142 I saw in my sleep what I will now tell, with the tongue of flesh, and with my breath, which the Great One has given men in the mouth, so that they might speak with it, and understand with the heart
143 As He has created, and appointed, men to understand the word of knowledge, so He created and appointed me to reprove the Watchers, the sons of Heaven
144 And I wrote out your petition, but in my vision, thus it appeared, that your petition would not be granted to you, for all the days of eternity; and complete judgment has been decreed against you, and you will not have peace
145 And from now on, you will not ascend into Heaven, for all eternity, and it has been decreed that you will be bound on Earth for all the days of eternity
146 And before this, you will have seen the destruction of your beloved sons, and you will not be able to enjoy them, but they will fall before you by the sword
147 And your petition will not be granted in respect of them or in respect of yourselves And while you weep and supplicate you do not speak a single word from the writings which I have written 
148 And the vision appeared to me, as follows: - Behold; clouds called me in the vision, and mist called me And the path of the stars, and flashes of lightning, hastened me and drove me And in the vision winds caused me to fly, and hastened me, and lifted me up into the sky
149 And I proceeded until I came near a wall which was made of hailstones, and a tongue of fire surrounded it, and it began to make me afraid
1410 And I went into the tongue of fire and came near to a large house,which was built of hailstones, and the wall of that house was like a mosaic of hailstones and its floor was snow
1411 Its roof was like the path of the stars and flashes of lightning, and among them was fiery cherubim, and their sky was like water
1412 And there was a fire burning around its wall and its door was ablaze with fire
1413 And I went into that house, and it was as hot as fire and as cold as snow, and there was neither pleasure nor life in it Fear covered me and trembling took hold of me
1414 And as I was shaking and trembling, I fell on my face
1415 And I saw in the vision, and behold, another house which was larger than the former and all its doors were open before me, and it was built of a tongue of fire
1416 And in everything, it so excelled in glory and splendor and size, so that I am unable to describe to you its glory and its size
1417 And its floor was fire, and above lightning and the path of the stars, and its roof also was a burning fire
1418 And I looked, and I saw in it, a high throne, and its appearance was like ice, and its surrounds like the shining Sun and the sound of cherubim
1419 And from underneath the high throne there flowed out rivers of fire so that it was impossible to look at it
1420 And He who is Great in Glory sat upon it, and his raiment was brighter than the Sun, and whiter than any snow
1421 And no Angel could enter, and at the appearance of the face of Him who is Honoured and Praised, no creature of flesh could look
1422 A sea of fire burnt around Him, and a great fire stood in front of Him, and none of those around Him came near to Him Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him but He needed no Holy Council
1423 And the Holy Ones who were near to Him did not leave by night or day and did not depart from Him
1424 And until then I had a covering on my face, as I trembled And the Lord called me with his own mouth, and said to me: "Come here, Enoch, to my Holy Word"
1425 And He lifted me up and brought me near to the door And I looked, with my face down
151 And He answered me, and said to me with His voice: "Hear! Do not be afraid, Enoch, you righteous man, and scribe of righteousness Come here and hear my voice
152 And go say to the Watchers of Heaven, who sent you to petition on their behalf: You ought to petition on behalf of men, not men on behalf of you
153 Why have you left the High, Holy and Eternal Heaven, and lain with women, and become unclean with the daughters of men, and taken wives for yourselves, and done as the sons of the earth, and begotten giant sons?
154 And you were spiritual, Holy, living an eternal life, but you became unclean upon the women, and begot children through the blood of flesh, and lusted after the blood of men, and produced flesh and blood, as they do, who die and are destroyed
155 And for this reason I give men wives; so that they might sow seed in them, and so that children might be born by them, so that deeds might be done on the Earth
156 But you, formerly, were spiritual, living an eternal, immortal life, for all the generations of the world
157 For this reason I did not arrange wives for you; because the dwelling of the spiritual ones is in Heaven
158 And now, the giants who were born from body and flesh will be called Evil Spirits on the Earth, and on the Earth will be their dwelling
159 And evil spirits came out from their flesh, because from above they were created, from the Holy Watchers was their origin and first foundation Evil spirits they will be on Earth and ‘Spirits of the Evil Ones’ they will be called
1510 And the dwelling of the Spirits of Heaven is Heaven, but the dwelling of the spirits of the Earth, who were born on the Earth, is Earth
1511 And the spirits of the giants do wrong, are corrupt, attack, fight, break on the Earth, and cause sorrow And they eat no food, do not thirst, and are not observed
1512 And these spirits will rise against the sons of men, and against the women, because they came out of them during the days of slaughter and destruction
161 And the death of the giants, wherever the spirits have gone out from their bodies, their flesh will be destroyed, before the Judgment Thus they will be destroyed until the Day of the Great Consummation is accomplished, upon the Great Age, upon the Watchers and the impious ones"
162 And now to the Watchers, who sent you to petition on their behalf, who were formerly in Heaven:
163 "You were in Heaven but its secrets had not yet been revealed to you; and a worthless mystery you knew This you made known to women, in the hardness of your hearts And through this mystery the women and the men cause evil to increase on the Earth"
164 Say to them therefore: "You will not have peace"
Notes Start: (7) ENOCH STAYS FOR A WHILE WITH THE WATCHERS (pages 31-33)
This section describes Enoch's impressions on being shown around by the Watchers
At 171, he says he was at a place where the Watchers were like burning fire, (I
do not know what this means, although it does remind me of Moses and the burning
bush), but he also says that they could look like men
The description at 175 reminds me of volcanic larva flows, such as in Iceland
where new land is being created
The mountains mentioned at 186 are referred to again later in the book I have
often wondered if it would be possible to identify this place from these descriptions
The best match I have found so far is the South Sandwich island group The main
island has now been submerged but the mountain tops now form the chain of islands
For more on this, read ‘Thoth Architect of the Universe’ by Ralph Ellis
This part ends with more details of the punishment for the runaways

7) ENOCH STAYS FOR A WHILE WITH THE WATCHERS
171 And they took me to a place where they were like burning fire, and, when they wished, they made themselves look like men
172 And they led me to a place of storm, and to a mountain, the tip of whose summit reached to Heaven
173 And I saw lighted places, and thunder in the outermost ends, in its depths a bow of fire, and arrows and their quivers, and a sword of fire, and all the flashes of lightning
174 And they took me to the Water of Life, as it is called, and to the Fire of the West, which receives every setting of the Sun
175 And I came to a river of fire, whose fire flows like water, and pours out into the Great Sea, which is towards the west
176 And I saw all the great rivers, and I reached the Great Darkness, and went where all flesh walks
177 And I saw the Mountains of the Darkness of Winter and the place where the water of all the deeps pours out
178 And I saw the mouths of all the rivers of the Earth, and the mouth of the deep
181 And I saw the storehouses of all the winds, and I saw how with them He has adorned all creation, and I saw the foundations of the Earth 
182 And I saw the cornerstone of the Earth And I saw the four winds which support the Earth and the sky
183 And I saw how the winds stretch out the height of Heaven, and how they position themselves between Heaven and Earth; they are the Pillars of Heaven
184 And I saw the winds which turn the sky and cause the disc of the Sun and all the stars to set
185 And I saw the winds on the Earth which support the clouds and I saw the paths of the Angels I saw at the end of the Earth; the firmament of Heaven above
186 And I went towards the south, and it was burning day and night, where there were seven mountains of precious stones, three towards the east and three towards the south
187 And those towards the east were of coloured stone, and one was of pearl, and one of healing stone; and those towards the south, of red stone
188 And the middle one reached to Heaven, like the throne of the Lord, of stibium, and the top of the throne was of sapphire
189 And I saw a burning fire, and what was in all the mountains 
1810 And I saw a place there, beyond the great earth; there the waters gathered together
1811 And I saw a deep chasm of the earth, with pillars of heavenly fire, and I saw among them fiery pillars of Heaven, which were falling, and as regards both height and depth, they were immeasurable
1812 And beyond this chasm, I saw a place, and it had neither the sky above it, nor the foundation of earth below it; there was no water on it, and no birds, but it was a desert place
1813 And a terrible thing I saw there, seven stars, like great burning mountains
1814 And like a spirit questioning me, the Angel said: “This is the place of the end of Heaven and Earth; this is the prison for the Stars of Heaven and the Host of Heaven
1815 And the stars which roll over the fire, these are the ones which transgressed the command of the Lord, from the beginning of their rising, because they did not come out at their proper times
1816 And He was angry with them, and bound them until the time of the consummation of their sin, in the Year of Mystery”
191 And Uriel said to me: “The spirits of the Angels who were promiscuous with women will stand here; and they, assuming many forms, made men unclean and will lead men astray so that they sacrifice to demons as gods And they will stand there until the great judgment day, on which they will be judged, so that an end will be made of them
192 And their wives, having led astray the Angels of Heaven, will become peaceful”
193 And I, Enoch, alone saw the sight, the ends of everything; and no man has seen what I have seen
Notes Start: (8) THE ANGELS WHO KEEP WATCH (pages 35-37)
Here we are introduced to some of the Watchers and then Enoch has a
conversation with them At first they discuss the punishment of the runaways then the
afterlife in general
The Watchers may have provided some type of visual display since Enoch
describes what he sees The description at 222 is strange but compelling
The story of Cain and Abel is mentioned at 227 and in the next section the story
of Adam and Eve is mentioned, at 326 So, these stories must have existed, in some
form, even in Enoch's time
Notes End: (8) THE ANGELS WHO KEEP WATCH 
8) THE ANGELS WHO KEEP WATCH
201 And these are the names of the Holy Angels who keep watch
202 Uriel, one of the Holy Angels; namely the Holy Angel of the Spirits of Men
204 Raguel, one of the Holy Angels; who takes vengeance on the world, and on the lights
205 Michael, one of the Holy Angels, namely the one put in charge of the best part of humankind, in charge of the nation
206 Saraqael, one of the Holy Angels; who is in charge of the spirits of men who cause the spirits to sin
207 Gabriel, one of the Holy Angels, who is in charge of the Serpents, and the Garden, and the Cherubim
211 And I went round to a place where nothing was made
212 And I saw a terrible thing, neither the High Heaven nor the firm ground, but a desert place, prepared and terrible
213 And there, I saw seven Stars of Heaven, bound on it together, like great mountains, and burning like fire
214 Then I said: “For what sin have they been bound, and why have they been thrown here?”
215 And Uriel, one of the Holy Angels, who was with me and led me, spoke to me and said: "Enoch, about whom do you ask? About whom do you inquire, ask, and care?
216 These are some of the stars which transgressed the command of the Lord Most High, and they have been bound here until ten thousand ages are completed; the number of days of their sin"
217 And from there I went to another place, more terrible than this And I saw a terrible thing: there was a great fire there, which burnt and blazed And the place had a cleft reaching into the abyss, full of great pillars of fire, which were made to fall; neither its extent nor its size could I see, nor could I see its source
218 Then I said: "How terrible this place is, and how painful to look at!"
219 Then Uriel, one of the Holy Angels, who was with me, answered me He answered me and said to me: "Enoch, why do you have such fear and terror because of this terrible place, and before this pain?"
2110 And he said to me: "This place is the prison of the Angels, and there they will be held for ever"
221 And from there, I went to another place, and he showed me in the west a large and high mountain, and a hard rock, and four beautiful places
222 And inside, it was deep, wide, and very smooth How smooth is that which rolls, and deep and dark to look at!
223 Then Raphael, one of the Holy Angels who was with me, answered me, and said to me: "These beautiful places are there so that the spirits, the souls of the dead, might be gathered into them For them they were created; so that here they might gather the souls of the sons of men
224 And these places they made, where they will keep them until the Day of Judgment, and until their appointed time, and that appointed time will be long, until the great judgment comes upon them
225 And I saw the spirits of the sons of men who were dead and their voices reached Heaven and complained
226 Then I asked Raphael, the Angel who was with me, and said to him: "Whose is this spirit, whose voice thus reaches Heaven and complains?"
227 And he answered me, and said to me, saying: "This spirit is the one that came out of Abel, whom Cain, his brother, killed And he will complain about him until his offspring are destroyed from the face of the Earth, and from amongst the offspring of men, his offspring perish"
228 Then I asked about him, and about judgment on all, and I said: "Why is one separated from another?"
229 And he answered me, and said to me: "These three places where made, in order that they might separate the spirits of the dead And thus the souls of the righteous have been separated; this is the spring of water, and on it the light
2210 Likewise, a place has been created for sinners, when they die, and are buried in the earth, and judgment has not come upon them during their life
2211 And here their souls will be separated for this great torment, until the Great Day of Judgment and Punishment and Torment for those who curse, forever, and of vengeance on their souls And there he will bind them forever Verily, He is, from the beginning of the world
2212 And thus a place has been separated for the souls of those who complain, and give information about their destruction, about when they were killed, in the days of the sinners
2213 Thus a place has been created, for the souls of men who are not righteous, but sinners, accomplished in wrongdoing, and with the wrongdoers will be their lot But their souls will not be killed on the day of judgment, nor will they rise from here"
2214 Then I blessed the Lord of Glory, and said: "Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of Glory and Righteousness, who rules everything forever"
231 And from there I went to another place, towards the west, to the ends of the Earth
232 And I saw a fire that burnt and ran, without resting or ceasing from running, by day or by night, but continued in exactly the same way
233 And I asked saying: "What is this which has no rest?"
234 Then Raguel, one of the Holy Angels, who was with me, answered me, and said to me: “This burning fire, whose course you saw towards the west, is the fire of all the Lights of Heaven”
Notes Start: (9) THE FRAGRANT TREES (pages 39-44)
In this section, Enoch is taken on another tour At the beginning, 241, there is
perhaps a volcano Then the seven mountains again, 242-3, this time with more detail
From-243 to 256, there are the fragrant trees These sound like cannabis to me
The description at 256 of "drawing the fragrance into the bones’’, is quite an apt
description of smoking it The part where it says, at 254, "no one will have authority to
touch it,” could represent the present prohibition
At 311 Enoch mentions galbanum, this is one of the ingredients of the incense
that was to be burned on the Incense Altar in the Tent of Appointment, Exodus 30:34
Also, at 323-6, the Tree of Wisdom also sounds like cannabis Here we get a
new insight into the Adam and Eve story
At 333-4, Enoch mentions how Uriel gave him notes on astronomy These
notes are in this book as sections 13, 14, and 16
The angel Zotiel is mentioned at 322, east of the Red Sea, there are suggestions
based on weathering data that The Sphinx is much older (pre 10,000 BC) than the
pyramids, so this is a possible candidate for Zotiel
Notes End: (9) THE FRAGRANT TREES 
9) THE FRAGRANT TREES
241 And from there I went to another place of the Earth and he showed me a mountain of fire that blazed day and night
242 And I went towards it and saw seven magnificent mountains And all were different from one another, and precious and beautiful stones, and all were precious, and their appearance glorious, and their form was beautiful Three towards the east one fixed firmly on another and three towards the south one on another, and deep and rugged valleys, no one of which was near another
243 And there was a seventh mountain, in the middle of these, and in their height they were all like the seat of a throne and fragrant trees surrounded it
244 And there was among them a tree such as which I have never smelt, and none of them, or any others, were like it It smells more fragrant than any fragrance, and its leaves, and its flowers, and its wood never wither Its fruit is good, and its fruit is like bunches of dates on a palm
245 And then I said: "Behold, this beautiful tree! Beautiful to look at, and pleasant are its leaves, and its fruit very delightful in appearance"
246 And then Michael, one of the Holy and Honoured Angels, who was with me, and was in charge of them,
251 answered me and said to me: “Enoch, why do you ask me about the fragrance of this tree, and why do you inquire to learn?”
252 Then I, Enoch, answered him saying: “I wish to learn about everything, but especially about this tree”
253 And he answered me, saying: “This high mountain, which you saw, whose summit is like the Throne of the Lord, is the throne where the Holy and Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when he comes down to visit the Earth for good
254 And this beautiful and fragrant tree, and no creature of flesh has authority to touch it until the great judgment, when he will take vengeance on all and bring everything to a consummation forever, this will be given to the righteous and the humble
255 From its fruit, life will be given to the chosen; towards the north it will be planted, in a Holy place, by the house of the Lord, the Eternal King
256 Then they will rejoice with joy and be glad in the Holy place They will each draw the fragrance of it into their bones, and they will live a long life on earth, as your fathers lived And in their days sorrow and pain, and toil and punishment, will not touch them”
257 Then I blessed the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, because he has prepared such things for righteous men, and has created such things, and said that they are to be given to them
261 And from there, I went to the middle of the earth, and saw a blessed, well watered place, which had branches which remained alive, and sprouted from a tree which had been cut down
262 And there I saw a holy mountain, and under the mountain, to the east of it, there was water, and it flowed towards the south
263 And I saw towards the east, another mountain, which was of the same height, and between them, there was a deep and narrow valley; and in it, a stream ran by the mountain
264 And to the west of this one, was another mountain, which was lower than it was and not high; and under it, there was a valley between them And there were other deep and dry valleys at the end of the three mountains
265 And all the valleys were deep and narrow, of hard rock, and trees were planted on them
266 And I was amazed at the rock, and I was amazed at the valley; I was very much amazed
271 Then I said: "What is the purpose of this blessed land, which is completely full of trees, and of this accursed valley in the middle of them?"
272 Then Raphael, one of the Holy Angels who was with me, answered me, and said to me: "This accursed valley, is for those who are cursed for ever Here will be gathered together all who speak with their mouths against the Lord - words that are not fitting, and say hard things about His Glory Here they will gather them together, and here will be their place of judgment
273 And in the last days there will be the spectacle of the righteous judgment upon them, in front of the righteous, forever For here, the merciful will bless the Lord of Glory the Eternal King
274 And in the days of the judgment on them they will bless Him, on account of his mercy, according as He has assigned to them their lot"
275 Then I myself blessed the Lord of Glory, I addressed Him, and I remembered His majesty, as was fitting
281 And from there, I went towards the east, to the middle of the mountain of the wilderness, and I saw only desert
282 But it was full of trees from this seed and water gushed out over it from above
283 The torrent, which flowed towards the northwest, seemed copious, and from all sides, there went up spray and mist
291 And I went to another place, away from the wilderness; I came near to the east of this mountain
292 And there I saw Trees of Judgment, especially vessels of the fragrance of incense and myrrh, and the trees were not alike
301 And above it, above these, above the mountains of the east, and not far away, I saw another place, valleys of water, like that which does not fail
302 And I saw a beautiful tree, and its fragrance was like that of the mastic
303 And by the banks of these valleys I saw fragrant cinnamon And beyond those valleys I came towards the east
311 And I saw another mountain on which there were trees, and there flowed out water, and there flowed out from it, as it were, a nectar whose name is styrax and galbanum
312 And beyond this mountain I saw another mountain, and on it there were aloe trees, and those trees were full of a fruit, which is like an almond, and is hard
313 And when they take this fruit it is better than any fragrance
321 And after these fragrances, to the north, as I looked over the mountains, I saw seven mountains full of fine nard, and fragrant trees of cinnamon and pepper
322 And from there, I went over the summits of those mountains, far away to the east, and I went over the Red Sea, and I was far from it, and I went over the Angel Zotiel
323 And I came to the Garden of Righteousness, and I saw beyond those trees many large trees growing there, sweet smelling, large, very beautiful and glorious, the Trees of Wisdom, from which they eat and know great wisdom
324 And it is like the carob tree, and its fruit is like bunches of grapes on a vine, very beautiful, and the smell of this tree spreads and penetrates afar
325 And I said: "This tree is beautiful! How beautiful and pleasing is its appearance!"
326 And the Holy Angel Raphael, who was with me, answered me and said to me: "This is the Tree of Wisdom, from which your ancient father and ancient mother, who were before you, ate and learnt wisdom; and their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked And they were driven from the garden"
331 And from there I went to the ends of the earth, and I saw there large animals, each different from the other, and also birds, which differed in form, beauty, and call - each different from the other
332 And to the east of these animals, I saw the ends of the Earth, on which Heaven rests, and the open Gates of Heaven
333 And I saw how the stars of Heaven come out, and counted the Gates out of which they come, and wrote down all their outlets, for each one, individually, according to their number And their names, according to their constellations, their positions, their times, and their months, as the Angel Uriel, who was with me, showed me
334 And he showed me everything, and wrote it down, and also their names he wrote down for me, and their laws and their functions
341 And from there I went towards the north, to the ends of the Earth, and there I saw a great and glorious wonder at the ends of the whole Earth
342 And there I saw three Gates of Heaven; through each of them north winds go out; when they blow there is cold, hail, hoarfrost, snow, fog, and rain
343 And from one Gate, it blows for good; but when they blow through the other two Gates, it is with force, and it brings torment over the earth, and they blow with force
351 And from there I went towards the west, to the ends of the Earth, and I saw there, as I saw in the east, three open Gates - as many Gates and as many outlets
361 And from there I went towards the south, to the ends of the Earth, and there I saw three Gates of Heaven open; and the south wind, the mist, and the rain, and wind, come out from there
362 And from there I went towards the east of the ends of Heaven, and there I saw the three eastern Gates of Heaven open, and above them, there were smaller Gates
363 Through each of these smaller Gates, the stars of Heaven pass, and go towards the west, on the path that has been shown to them
364 And when I saw, I blessed, and I will always bless the Lord of Glory, who has made Great and Glorious Wonders so that he might show the greatness of His Work, to His Angels, and to the souls of men, so that they might praise His Work And so that all his creatures might see the work of His Power, and praise the great work of His Hands, and bless Him forever!
Notes Start: (10) THE BOOK OF METHUSELAH (pages 46-48)
This short section has many interesting features The story is set some years
later Methuselah is now head of the family (since Enoch went off to live with the
Angels, (see 816), a year after he wrote the book) Methuselah's son Lamech is now
grown up, and his first son is born At 1062, we get a description of the child who will
be named Noah
It seems he had white or blonde hair, a red birthmark, and perhaps blue eyes
Even more surprising, at 1065, we learn that this is what the Watchers look like If
some of the wives of Enoch's family were descended from the runaways, then Lamech
could easily have had an unexpectedly blonde-haired child
Lamech is disturbed about his baby's unusual appearance, and goes to see
Methuselah This section seems to have been written by Methuselah, to reassure his son
about the birth, written as though a reply from Enoch himself
Methuselah claims he went and spoke to Enoch, but I suspect that this is just a
device, in order to give enough authority to the message, so that Lamech can be
reassured
The naming of Noah at 1073 is interesting, since it links the name to the word
comfort Noah still sounds like the Hebrew word for comfort, and a similar story is told
at Genesis 5:29

10) THE BOOK OF METHUSELAH
1061 And after those days my son Methuselah chose a wife for his son
Lamech and she became pregnant by him and bore a son
1062 And his body was white like snow, and red like the flower of a rose,
and the hair of his head was white like wool And his eyes were beautiful
and when he opened his eyes he made the whole house bright, like the Sun,
so that the whole house was exceptionally bright
1063 And when he was taken from the hand of the midwife he opened his
mouth and spoke to the Lord of Righteousness
1064 And his father Lamech was afraid of him, and fled, and went to his
father Methuselah
1065 And he said to him: "I have begotten a strange son; he is not like a
man but is like the children of the Angels of Heaven, of a different type and
not like us And his eyes are like the rays of the Sun and his face glorious
1066 And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the
Angels and I am afraid that something extraordinary may be done on the
earth in his days
1067 And now, my father, I am entreating you and petitioning you, to go
to our father Enoch, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling is with
the Angels"
1068 And when Methuselah heard the words of his son he came to me, at
the ends of the Earth, for he had heard that I was there And he cried out,
and I heard his voice and went to him And I said to him: "Behold I am
here my son, for you have come to me"
1069 And he answered me, and said: "Because of a great matter I have
come to you, and because of a disturbing vision, have I come near
10610 And now hear me, my father, for a child has been born to my son
Lamech, whose form and type are not like the type of a man His colour is
46



whiter than snow, and redder than the flower of the rose, and the hair of his
head is whiter than white wool And his eyes are like the rays of the Sun;
and he opened his eyes and made the whole house bright
10611 And he was taken from the hand of the midwife, and he opened his
mouth, and blessed the Lord of Heaven
10612 And his father Lamech was afraid and fled to me And he does not
believe he is sprung from him but thinks him to be from the Angels of
Heaven And behold, I have come to you, so that you may make known to
me the truth"
10613 And I, Enoch, answered and said to him: "The Lord will do new
things on Earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and made known
to you For in the generation of my father, Jared, some from the height of
Heaven transgressed the word of the Lord
10614 And behold, they commit sin and transgress the law, and have been
promiscuous with women, and commit sin with them, and have married
some of them, and have begotten children by them
10615 And there will be great destruction over the whole Earth, and there
will be a deluge, and there will be great destruction for one year
10616 But this child, who has been born to you, will be left on the Earth,
and his three sons will be saved with him When all the men who are on
the Earth die he and his sons will be saved
10617 They will beget on the Earth giants, not of spirit, but of flesh, and
there will be great wrath on Earth, and the Earth will be cleansed of all
corruption
10618 And now make known to your son Lamech that the one who has
been born is truly his son And call his name Noah, for he will be a
remnant for you and he and his sons will be saved from the destruction
which is coming on the earth because of all the sin and all the iniquity,
which will be committed on the Earth in his days
10619 But after this, there will be yet greater iniquity than that which was
committed on the earth before For I know the mysteries of the Holy Ones,
for the Lord showed them to me and made them known to me, and I read
them in the Tablets of Heaven
1071 And I saw written on them, that generation upon generation will do
wrong, until a generation of righteousness shall arise, and wrongdoing shall
be destroyed, and sin shall depart from the earth, and everything good shall
come upon it
1072 And now, my son, go, make known to your son Lamech, that this
child that has been born, is truly his son, and this is no lie
1073 And when Methuselah had heard the words of his father Enoch - for
he showed him everything which is secret - he returned, having seen him,
and called the name of that child Noah; for he will comfort the Earth after
all the destruction
Notes Start: (11) THE BOOK OF NOAH (pages 50-53)
Noah's book was probably written when he was the head of the family and like
Methuselah he claims to speak with Enoch He seems to have written this before the
flood; and once again there are some interesting details
The most important passage is at 672 This indicates that the boat is being
constructed at the time of writing Noah may have written this piece in order to
persuade his sons to come and live with him, inside "the wooden structure” Noah may
not have seen a boat like this before, and perhaps was not sure what to call it
There seems to be a background of unusual geological events At the beginning,
651, Noah says the earth has tilted, later, at 6711, he says the Hot Springs became
cold This does fit with the theories of Charles Hapgood in his book ‘The Path of the
Pole’ where he suggests that the huge ice melt (that probably caused the flood) occurred
when the poles shifted – perhaps due to an impact from space The North Pole shifted
from Hudson’s Bay to its present position At 653 Noah says the earth is ‘afflicted and
shaken’ and he does seem quite alarmed by it
There is also talk of molten metal and a smell of sulphur, 676, but this may be
pollution from the metalworking described at 657 Production of metals, and weapons,
may have become quite large scale by Noah's time

651 And in those days, Noah saw the Earth had tilted and that its
destruction was near
652 And he set off from there and went to the ends of the Earth and cried
out to his great-grandfather Enoch; and Noah said three times in a bitter
voice: "Hear me, hear me, hear me!"
653 And he said to him: "Tell me, what is it that is being done on the
Earth, that the Earth is so afflicted and shaken, lest I be destroyed with it!"
654 And immediately there was a great disturbance on the Earth and a
voice was heard from Heaven and I fell upon my face
655 And my great-grandfather Enoch came, stood by me, and said to me:
"Why did you cry out to me, with such bitter crying and weeping?
656 And a command has gone out from the Lord against those who dwell
upon the dry ground that this must be their end For they have learnt all the
secrets of the Angels, and all the wrongdoings of the satans, and all their
secret power, and all the power of those who practice magic arts, and the
power of enchantments, and the power of those who cast molten images for
all the Earth
657 And further, how silver is produced from the dust of the earth and how
soft metal occurs on the earth
658 For lead and tin are not produced from the earth, like the former; there
is a spring which produces them, and an Angel who stands in it, and that
Angel distributes them"
659 And after this, my great-grandfather Enoch took hold of me with his
hand, and raised me, and said to me: "Go, for I have asked the Lord of
Spirits about this disturbance on the earth"
6510 And he said to me: “Because of their iniquity, their judgment has been completed, and they will no longer be counted before me; because of the sorceries they have searched out and learnt, the Earth and those who dwell upon it will be destroyed
6511 And for these, there will be no place of refuge, for ever, for they
showed to them what is secret, and they have been condemned; but not so
for you, my son; the Lord of Spirits knows that you are pure and innocent
of this reproach concerning the secrets
6512 And he has established your name among the Holy, and will keep
you from amongst those who dwell upon the dry ground; and he has
destined your offspring in righteousness, to be kings, and for great honours
And from your offspring will flow out a spring of the Righteous and Holy,
without number forever”
661 And after this, he showed me the Angels of Punishment, who were
ready to come and release all the forces of the water, which is under the
earth, in order to bring judgment and destruction on all those who reside
and dwell upon the dry ground
662 And the Lord of Spirits commanded the Angels who were coming out,
not to raise their hands, but to keep watch; for those Angels were in charge
of the forces of the waters
663 And I came out from before Enoch
671 And in those days, the word of the Lord came to me, and he said to
me: "Noah, behold; your lot has come up before me, a lot without
reproach, a lot of love and uprightness
672 And now the Angels are making a wooden structure, and when the
Angels come out from that task, I will put my hand on it, and keep it safe
And a change shall take place so that the dry ground may not remain
empty
673 And I will establish your offspring before me, forever and ever, and I
will scatter those who dwell with you, over the face of the dry ground I
will not again put them to the test, on the face of the Earth, but they will be
51



blessed and increase on the dry ground in the name of the Lord"
674 And they will shut up those Angels, who showed iniquity, in that
burning valley, which my great-grandfather Enoch had shown to me
previously, in the west, near the mountains of gold and silver and iron and
soft metal and tin
675 And I saw that valley, in which there was a great disturbance, and a
heaving of the waters
676 And when all this happened, from the fiery molten metal, and the
disturbance, which disturbed the waters in that place, a smell of sulphur
was produced, and it was associated with those waters And that valley of
the Angels, who led men astray, burns under the ground
677 And through the valleys of that same area, flow out rivers of fire
where those Angels will be punished, who led astray those on the dry
ground
678 And in those days, those waters will serve the kings, and the mighty,
and the exalted, and those who dwell upon dry ground, for the healing of
soul and body, but also for the punishment of the spirit And their spirits
are so full of lust that they will be punished in their bodies, for they denied
the Lord of Spirits And they see their punishment every day yet they do
not believe in His Name
679 And the more their bodies are burnt, the more a change will come over
their spirits, for ever and ever; for no one can speak an idle word in front of
the Lord of Spirits
6710 For judgment will come upon them, for they believe in the lust of
their bodies, but deny the spirit of the Lord
6711 And those same waters will undergo a change in those days; for
when those Angels are punished in those days, the temperature of those
springs of water will change, and when the Angels come up, that water of
the springs will change, and become cold
6712 And I heard the Holy Michael answering and saying: "This
judgment, with which the Angels are judged, is a testimony for the kings
and the mighty who possess the dry ground
6713 For these waters of judgment serve for the healing of the bodies of
the kings, and for the lust of their bodies; but they do not see, and do not
believe, that these waters will change, and will become a fire which burns forever"
681 And after this, my great-grandfather Enoch gave me the explanation of
all the secrets, in a book, and the parables that had been given to him; and
he put them together for me, in the words of the Book of Parables
Notes Start: (12) THE BOOK OF PARABLES (pages 55-85)
This part of Enoch's book is introduced by a quote from the "Holy One,” at 373;
this is the headman of the Watchers, and what he says is almost an apology Enoch's
parables are actually three essays, which outline the future path of spiritual
enlightenment, as explained to him by the Holy One
The content of the second two parables is similar; the main theme is a Messiah, who
will bring guidance at the correct time This eventually brings about an age of
enlightenment, where the souls of the righteous can live in peace

371 The second vision that he saw, the vision of wisdom, which Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Malalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, saw
372 And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom, which I raised my voice to speak, and say “To those who dwell on dry ground: - Hear, you men of old, and see, those who come after; the words of the Holy One, which I will speak, in front of the Lord of Spirits”
373 “It would have been better to have said these things before, but from those who come after, we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom”
374 Until now, there has not been given, by the Lord of Spirits, such wisdom as I have received In accordance with my insight, in accordance with the wish of the Lord of Spirits: by whom the lot of eternal life has been given to me
375 And the three parables were imparted to me and I raised my voice, and said to those who dwell on the dry ground:
Notes Start: The First Parable (Pages 56-62)
The first part of this parable is possibly a description of a holy place set in the
future; Enoch seems to consider it a description of the Watchers home also, since at
398, he reveals that he is being allowed to live there, with them ‘Those who do not sleep’ (see 3912 and 717) are mentioned often These are the seraphim, cherubim, and ophannim, the non-human angels, who do not need to sleep Enoch never describes them, so it is difficult to know what he had in mind Most of this parable is a description of how four of the Watchers showed Enoch everything
Notes End: The First Parable 
381 The First Parable
When the community of the righteous appears and the sinners are judged for their sins and are driven from the face of the dry ground
382 And when the Righteous One appears, in front of the chosen righteous, whose works are weighed by the Lord of Spirits And when light appears to the righteous and chosen who dwell on the dry ground Where will be the dwelling of the sinners? And where will be the resting place of those who denied the Lord of Spirits? It would have been better for them, if they had not been born 383 And when the secrets of the righteous are revealed, the sinners will be judged, and the impious driven from the presence of the righteous and the chosen
384 And from then on, those who possess the earth will not be mighty and exalted Nor will they be able to look at the face of the Holy ones, for the light of the Lord of the Spirits will have appeared on the face of the Holy, the righteous, and the chosen
385 And the mighty kings will at that time be destroyed and given into the hand of the righteous and the Holy
386 And from then on no one will be able to seek the Lord of Spirits for their life will be at an end
391 And it will come to pass in these days that the chosen and holy children will come down from the high Heavens and their offspring will become one with the sons of men
392 In those days Enoch received books of indignation and anger and books of tumult and confusion And there will be no mercy for them, says the Lord of Spirits
393 And at that time clouds and a storm wind carried me off from the face of the earth and set me down at the end of Heaven
394 And there I saw another vision; the Dwelling of the Righteous and the Resting-Places of the Holy
395 There my eyes saw their dwelling with the Angels, and their resting places with the Holy Ones, and they were petitioning and supplicating and praying, on behalf of the sons of men; and righteousness, like water, flowed in front of them, and mercy like dew on the ground Thus it is among them forever and ever
396 And in those days my eyes saw the Place of the Chosen Ones of Righteousness and Faith; and there will be righteousness in their days, and the righteous and chosen will be without number, in front of him, forever and ever
397 And I saw their dwelling, under the Wings of the Lord of Spirits, and
all the righteous and chosen shone in front of him, like the light of fire
And their mouths were full of blessing, and their lips praised the name of
the Lord of Spirits And righteousness will not fail in front of him, and
truth will not fail in front of him
398 There I wished to dwell, and my soul longed for that dwelling; there
had my lot been assigned before, for thus it was decided about me, in front
of the Lord of Spirits
399 And in those days I praised and exalted the name of the Lord of
Spirits, with blessing and praise, for he has destined me for blessing and
praise, in accordance with the Lord of Spirits
3910 And for a long time my eyes looked at that place, and I blessed him and praised him, saying: "Blessed is He, and may He be blessed from the beginning and for ever!"
3911 And in his presence there is no end He knew before the world was created what the world would be, even for all the generations that are to come
3912 Those who do not sleep bless you, and they stand before Your Glory, and bless and praise and exalt, saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Spirits; he fills the earth with spirits"
3913 And there, my eyes saw all those who do not sleep; standing in front
of Him, and blessing, and saying: "Blessed are you, and blessed is the
name of the Lord, for ever and ever!"
3914 And my face was transformed until I was unable to see
401 And after this I saw a thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten
thousand! A multitude beyond number, or reckoning, who stood in front of
the Glory of the Lord of Spirits
402 I looked, and on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits, I saw four
figures, different from those who were standing; and I learnt their names,
because the Angel who went with me made known their names, and
showed me all the secret things
403 And I heard the voices of those four figures as they sang praises in
front of the Lord of Glory
404 The first voice blesses the Lord of Spirits forever and ever
405 And the second voice I heard blessing the Chosen One and the chosen
who depend on the Lord of Spirits
406 And the third voice I heard, petitioned, and prayed, on behalf of those
who dwell on dry ground and supplicate in the name of the Lord of Spirits
407 And the fourth voice I heard driving away the Satans and not allowing
them to come in front of the Lord of Spirits to accuse those who dwell on
the high ground
408 And after this I asked the Angel of Peace, who went with me, and
showed me everything which is secret: "Who are those four figures, whom
I have seen, and whose words I have heard and written down?"
409 And he said to me: "This first one, is the Holy Michael, the merciful
and long-suffering And the second, who is in charge of all the diseases,
and in charge of all the wounds of the sons of men, is Raphael And the
third, who is in charge of all the powers, is the Holy Gabriel And the
59



fourth, who is in charge of repentance and hope of those who will inherit
eternal life, is Phanuel”
4010 And these are the four Angels of the Lord Most High; and the four
voices that I heard in those days
411 And after this, I saw all the secrets of Heaven, and how the Kingdom
is divided, and how the deeds of men are weighed in the Balance
412 There I saw the Dwelling of the Chosen, and the Resting Places of the
Holy; and my eyes saw there all the sinners who deny the name of the Lord
of Spirits being driven from there And they dragged them off, and they
were not able to remain, because of the punishment that went out from the
Lord of Spirits
413 And there my eyes saw the secrets of the flashes of lightning and of
the thunder And the secrets of the winds, how they are distributed in order
to blow over the earth, and the secrets of the clouds, and of the dew; and
there I saw from where they go out, in that place And how, from there, the
dust of the earth is saturated
414 And there I saw closed storehouses from which the winds are
distributed, and the storehouse of the hail, and the storehouse of the mist,
and the storehouse of the clouds; and its cloud remained over the earth,
from the beginning of the world
415 And I saw the Chambers of the Sun and the Moon, where they go out,
and where they return And their glorious return; and how one is more
honoured than the other is And their magnificent course, and how they do
not leave their course, neither adding nor subtracting from their course
And how they keep faith in one another, observing their oath
416 And the Sun goes out first, and completes its journey at the command
of the Lord of Spirits - and his Name endures forever and ever
417 And after this is the hidden, and visible, path of the Moon, and it
travels the course of its journey, in that place, by day and by night One
60



stands opposite the other, in front of the Lord of Spirits, and they give
thanks, and sing praise, and do not rest, because their thanksgiving is like
rest to them
418 For the shining Sun makes many revolutions; for a blessing and for a
curse And the path of the journey of the Moon is for the righteous light
but for the sinners; darkness In the Name of the Lord, who has created a
division between light and darkness, and has divided the spirits of men, and
has established the spirits of the righteous, in the name of His
Righteousness
419 For no Angel hinders, and no power is able to hinder, because the
judge sees them all, and judges them all Himself
421 Wisdom found no place where she could dwell, and her dwelling was
in Heaven
422 Wisdom went out, in order to dwell among the sons of men, but did
not find a dwelling; wisdom returned to her place, and took her seat in the
midst of the Angels
423 And iniquity came out from her chambers; those whom she did not
seek she found, and dwelt among them, like rain in the desert, and like dew
on the parched ground
431 And again I saw flashes of lightning and the stars of Heaven, and I
saw how He called them all by their names, and they obeyed Him
432 And I saw the Balance of Righteousness, how they are weighed
according to their light, according to the width of their areas, and the day of
their appearing And how their revolutions produce lightning, and I saw
their revolutions, according to the number of the Angels, and how they
keep faith with one another
433 And I asked the Angel, who went with me and showed me what is
secret: "What are these?"
434 And he said to me: "Their likeness, the Lord of Spirits has shown to
you; these are the names of the righteous who, dwell on the dry ground and
believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever"
441 And other things I saw concerning lightning, how some of the stars
rise and become lightning but cannot lose their form

Notes Start: The Second Parable (Pages 64-73)
Here we are introduced to some new characters, there is the Chosen One, or
Messiah, and The Head of Days or ‘ancient of days’ (see also 7110) who appears in
Daniel 7:9-10 and seems to represent God
It is a bit confusing that Enoch sees characters from the future It may be that
the Watchers presented this to Enoch as a theatrical drama so that he could see it and
ask questions at the same time It was no doubt a deliberate policy not to give actual
names so that different readers in different eras would assume they new the names
When I read this, I think it obviously refers to Jesus, but many ages had a ‘chosen one’
The number of righteousness (474), that is reached, may refer to the twelve
times twelve thousand predicted to survive in the biblical Book of Revelations
Sheol is mentioned at 511, it is the name for hell used in early times and it is
also mentioned in the book of Genesis and book of Job, it means ‘the grave’ - but more
than just a hole in the ground
The mountains leap like rams at 514, this phrase also occurs in the bible
(Psalms 1144 & 6)
There is a rare mentioning of place names at 565 - Parthia and Medes - these were
ancient kingdoms in the Iran\Iraq area This is the area where Enoch probably lived but
it is difficult to know whether he originally used these names in his book, or whether
later translators substituted in their own names for the areas that they thought were
being referred to.
Notes End: The Second Parable (Pages 64-73)
451 And this is The Second Parable
About those who deny the Name of the Dwelling of the Holy Ones and of
the Lord of Spirits
452 They will not ascend into Heaven nor will they come upon the earth;
such will be the lot of the sinners who deny the Name of the Lord of Spirits
who will thus be kept for the Day of Affliction and Distress
453 “On that day the Chosen One will sit on the Throne of Glory and will
choose their works And their resting places will be without number and
their spirits within them will grow strong when they see My Chosen One
and those who appeal to My Holy and Glorious Name
454 And on that day I will cause My Chosen One to dwell among them
and I will transform Heaven and make it an Eternal Blessing and Light
455 And I will transform the dry ground and make it a blessing, and I will
cause My Chosen Ones to dwell upon it; but those who commit sin and evil
will not tread upon it
456 For I have seen, and have satisfied with peace, My Righteous Ones,
and have placed them in front of Me; but for the sinners My Judgement
draws near so that I may destroy them from the face of the earth”
461 And there I saw one who had a ‘Head of Days’ and his head was white
like wool And with him there was another whose face had the appearance
of a man and his face was full of grace like one of the Holy Angels
462 And I asked one of the Holy Angels, who went with me and showed
me all the secrets, about that Son of Man, who he was, and from where he
was, and why he went with the Head of Days
463 And he answered me, and said to me:
"This is the Son of Man who has righteousness and with whom
righteousness dwells He will reveal all the treasures of that which is
secret, for the Lord of Spirits has chosen him, and through uprightness his
lot has surpassed all others, in front of the Lord of Spirits, forever
64



464 And this Son of Man, who you have seen, will rouse the kings and the
powerful from their resting places, and the strong from their thrones, and
will loose the reins of the strong, and will break the teeth of the sinners
465 And he will cast down the kings from their thrones, and from their
kingdoms, for they do not exalt him, and do not praise him, and do not
humbly acknowledge from where their kingdom was given to them
466 And he will cast down the faces of the strong and shame will fill them,
and darkness will be their dwelling, and worms will be their resting place
And they will have no hope of rising from their resting-places, for they do
not exalt the name of the Lord of Spirits
467 And these are they who judge the Stars of Heaven, and raise their
hands against the Most High, and trample upon the dry ground, and dwell
upon it And all their deeds show iniquity, and their power rests on their
riches, and their faith is in their gods that they have made with their hands,
and they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits
468 And they will be driven from the houses of his congregation, and of
the faithful, who depend on the Name of the Lord of Spirits
471 And in those days, the prayer of the righteous, and the blood of the
righteous will have ascended from the Earth in front of the Lord of Spirits
472 In these days the Holy Ones who live in Heaven above will unite with
one voice, and supplicate, and pray, and praise, and give thanks, and bless,
in the name of the Lord of Spirits Because of the blood of the righteous
that has been poured out And because of the prayer of the righteous, so
that it may not cease in front of the Lord of Spirits, so that justice might be
done to them, and that their patience may not have to last forever"
473 And in those days, I saw the Head of Days sit down on the Throne of
his Glory and the Books of the Living were opened in front of him and all
His Host, which dwell in the Heavens above, and his Council were
standing in front of Him
65



474 And the hearts of the Holy Ones were full of joy that the number of
righteousness had been reached, and the prayer of the righteous had been
heard, and the blood of the righteous had not been required in front of the
Lord of Spirits
481 And in that place I saw an inexhaustible spring of righteousness and
many springs of wisdom surrounded it, and all the thirsty drank from them
and were filled with wisdom, and their dwelling was with the Righteous
and the Holy and the Chosen
482 And at that hour that Son of Man was named, in the presence of the
Lord of Spirits, and his name brought to the Head of Days
483 Even before the Sun and the constellations were created, before the
Stars of Heaven were made, his name was named in front of the Lord of
Spirits
484 He will be a staff to the righteous and the Holy, so that they may lean
on him and not fall, and he will be the Light of the Nations, and he will be
the hope of those who grieve in their hearts
485 All those who dwell upon the dry ground will fall down and worship
in front of him, and they will bless, and praise, and celebrate with psalms,
the name of the Lord of Spirits
486 And because of this he was chosen, and hidden in front of Him, before
the World was created, and forever
487 But the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits has revealed him to the Holy
and the righteous, for he has kept safe the lot of the righteous, for they have
hated and rejected this world of iniquity And all its works and its ways
they have hated in the name of the Lord of Spirits For in His name they
are saved and he is the one who will require their lives
488 And in those days the kings of the Earth, and the strong who possess
the dry ground, will have downcast faces because of the works of their
hands, for on the day of their distress and trouble they will not save
66



themselves
489 And I will give them into the hands of my chosen ones; like straw in
the fire, and like lead in water, so they will burn in front of the righteous,
and sink in front of the Holy, and no trace will be found of them
4810 And on the day of their trouble there will be rest on the earth and
they will fall down in front of him and will not rise And there will be no
one who will take them with his hands and raise them for they denied the
Lord of Spirits and his Messiah May the name of the Lord of Spirits be
blessed!
491 For wisdom has been poured out like water and glory will not fail in
front of Him forever and ever
492 For He is powerful in all the secrets of righteousness and iniquity will
pass away like a shadow, and will have no existence; for the Chosen One
stands in front of the Lord of Spirits and His Glory is for ever and ever, and
His Power for all generations
493 And in Him dwell the spirit of wisdom, and the spirit that gives
understanding, and the spirit of knowledge and of power, and the spirit of
those who sleep in righteousness
494 And he will judge the things that are secret, and no one will be able to
say an idle word in front of him, for he has been chosen in front of the Lord
of Spirits, in accordance with His wish
501 And in those days a change will occur for the Holy and the chosen; the
Light of Days will rest upon them, and glory and honour will return to the
Holy
502 And on the day of trouble, calamity will be heaped up over the
sinners, but the righteous will conquer in the Name of the Lord of Spirits
and He will show this to others so that they might repent and abandon the
works of their hands
503 And they will have no honour in front of the Lord of Spirits, but in His
67



Name they will be saved and the Lord of Spirits will have mercy on them,
for his mercy is great
504 And He is righteous in His judgment, and in front of His Glory
iniquity will not be able to stand against His Judgment; he who does not
repent will be destroyed
505 "And from then on I will not have mercy on them," says the Lord of
Spirits
511 And in those days the Earth will return that which has been entrusted
to it, and Sheol will return that which has been entrusted to it and that
which it has received And destruction will return what it owes
512 And He will choose the Righteous and the Holy from among them; for
the day has come near when they must be saved
513 And in those days, the Chosen One will sit on his throne, and all the
Secrets of Wisdom will flow out from the council of his mouth, for the
Lord of Spirits has appointed him and glorified him
514 And in those days the mountains will leap like rams, and the hills will
skip like lambs satisfied with milk, and all will become Angels in Heaven
515 Their faces will shine with joy, for in those days the Chosen One will
have risen and the earth will rejoice And the righteous will dwell upon it
and the chosen will walk upon it
521 And after those days, in that place where I had seen all the visions of
that which is secret, for I had been carried off by a whirlwind, and they had
brought me to the west
522 There my eyes saw the secrets of Heaven; everything that will occur
on Earth: a mountain of iron, and a mountain of copper, and a mountain of
silver, and a mountain of gold, and a mountain of soft metal, and a
mountain of lead
523 And I asked the Angel who went with me, saying:
"What are these things which I have seen in secret?"
68



524 And he said to me: "All these things which you have seen serve the
authority of His Messiah, so that he may be strong and powerful on the
Earth"
525 And that Angel of Peace answered me, saying: "Wait a little and you
will see, and everything which is secret, which the Lord of Spirits has
established, will be revealed to you
526 And these mountains, that you have seen; the mountain of iron, and
the mountain of copper, and the mountain of silver, and the mountain of
gold, and the mountain of soft metal, and the mountain of lead All these in
front of the Chosen One will be like wax before fire, and like the water that
comes down from above onto these mountains they will be weak under his
feet
527 And it will come to pass in those days, that neither by gold, nor by
silver, will men save themselves; they will be unable to save themselves, or
to flee
528 And there will be neither iron for war nor material for a breastplate;
bronze will be no use, and tin will be of no use and will count for nothing,
and lead will not be wanted
529 All these will be wiped out and destroyed from the face of the earth
when the Chosen One appears in front of the Lord of Spirits"
531 And there my eyes saw a deep valley, and its mouth was open; and all
those who dwell upon dry ground and the sea and the islands will bring
gifts and presents and offerings to him, but that deep valley will not
become full
532 And their hands commit evil, and everything at which the righteous
toil the sinners evilly devour; and so the sinners will be destroyed from in
front of the Lord of Spirits, and will be banished from the face of His Earth,
unceasingly for ever and ever
533 For I saw the Angels of Punishment going and preparing all the
69



instruments of Satan
534 And I asked the Angel of Peace, who went with me, and I said to him:
"These instruments - for whom are they preparing them?"
535 And he said to me: "They are preparing these for the kings and the
powerful of this Earth, so that by means of them they may be destroyed
536 And after this the Righteous and Chosen One will cause the house of
his congregation to appear; from then on, in the name of the Lord of Spirits,
they will not be hindered
537 And in front of him these mountains will not be firm like the earth,
and the hills will be like a spring of water; and the righteous will have rest
from the ill-treatment of the sinners"
541 And I looked, and turned to another part of the Earth, and I saw there a
deep valley with burning fire
542 And they brought the kings and powerful and threw them into that
valley
543 And there my eyes saw how they made instruments for them - iron
chains of immeasurable weight
544 And I asked the Angel of Peace, who went with me, saying: "These
chain instruments - for whom are they being prepared?"
545 And he said to me: "These are being prepared for the hosts of Azazel,
so that they may take them, and throw them into the lowest part of hell; and
they will cover their jaws with rough stones, as the Lord of Spirits
commanded
546 And Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel - these will take hold
of them on that great day And throw them, on that day, into the furnace of
burning fire, so that the Lord of Spirits may take vengeance on them for
their iniquity, in that they became servants of Satan, and led astray those
who dwell upon the dry ground
547 And in those days, the punishment of the Lord of Spirits will go out,
70



and all the storehouses of the waters which are above the sky and under the
earth, will be opened
548 And all the waters will be joined with the waters that are above the
sky The water that is above the sky is male and the water that is under the
Earth is female
549 And all those who dwell upon the dry ground, and those who dwell
under the ends of Heaven, will be wiped out
5410 And because of this they will acknowledge their iniquity which they
have committed on the Earth and through this they will be destroyed"
551 And after this, the Head of Days repented, and said:
"I have destroyed to no purpose all those who dwell upon the dry ground"
552 And he swore by His Great Name: "From now on I will not act like
this towards all those who dwell upon the dry ground And I will put a sign
in Heaven, and it will be a pledge of faith between me and them forever, so
long as Heaven is above the Earth
553 And this will be in accordance with my command When I want to
take hold of them with the hands of the Angels, on the day of distress and
pain, in the face of my anger and my wrath, my wrath and anger will
remain upon them" says the Lord, The Lord of Spirits
554 "You powerful kings who dwell upon the dry ground will be obliged
to watch my Chosen One sit down on the throne of My Glory, and judge, in
the Name of the Lord of Spirits, Azazel and all his associates and all his
hosts"
561 And I saw there the hosts of the Angels of Punishment, as they went,
and they were holding chains of iron and bronze
562 And I asked the Angel of Peace, who went with me, saying:
"To whom are those who are holding the chains going?"
563 And he said to me: "Each to his own chosen ones, and to their
beloved ones, so that they may be thrown into the chasm, in the depths of
71



the valley"
564 And then, that valley will be filled with their chosen and beloved ones,
and the days of their life will be at an end, and the days of their leading
astray will no longer be counted
565 And in those days, the Angels will gather together, and will throw
themselves towards the east, upon the Parthians and Medes They will stir
up the kings so that a disturbing spirit will come upon them, and they will
drive them from their thrones; and they will come out like lions from their
lairs, and like hungry wolves in the middle of their flocks
566 And they will go up and trample on the Land of My Chosen Ones, and
the land of my chosen ones will become before them a tramping-ground
and a beaten track
567 But the City of My Righteous Ones will be a hindrance to their horses,
and they will stir up slaughter amongst themselves, and their own right
hand will be strong against them And a man will not admit to knowing his
neighbour, or his brother, nor a son his father, or his mother, until, through
their death, there are corpses enough; and their punishment - it will not be
in vain
568 And in those days Sheol will open its mouth and they will sink into it
and their destruction; Sheol will swallow up the sinners in front of the faces
of the chosen"
571 And it came to pass, after this, that I saw another host of chariots with
men riding on them, and they came upon the wind from the east and from
the west, to the south
572 And the sound of the noise of their chariots was heard And when this
occurred the Holy Ones observed it from Heaven and the Pillars of the
Earth were shaken from their foundations And the sound was heard from
the ends of the Earth to the ends of Heaven throughout one day
573 And all will fall down and worship the Lord of Spirits And this is the end of the second parable
Notes Start: The Third Parable (Pages 75-85)
The two monsters mentioned at 607 are also mentioned in the book of Job
possibly the oldest book in the Bible See Job 4015 & 411 Behemoth is "the beast"
and Leviathan is "the monster of chaos,” but what they represent, in Enoch's book, is
not made clear At 6010, the Watchers say it is a secret and then they soon change the
subject
At 601 Enoch gives his age; it is written as 500 and not 50 in the Ethiopian copies I
feel this must be due to an ancient transcription error so I have substituted 50 as the
most likely alternative I suspect that Enoch had just had his exact age calculated by the
Watchers, based on the story of his birth, which would be a rare thing to know in the
days before calendars were in everyday use
Notes End: The Third Parable 
581 And I began to speak The Third Parable
About The Righteous and about The Chosen
582 Blessed are you, the righteous and the chosen, for your lot will be
glorious!
583 And the righteous will be in the light of the Sun and the chosen in the
light of eternal life And there will be no end to the days of their life and
the days of the Holy will be without number
584 And they will seek the light and will find righteousness with the Lord
of Spirits Peace be to the righteous with the Lord of the World!
585 And after this it will be said to the Holy that they should seek in
Heaven the secrets of righteousness, the lot of faith; for it has become
bright as the Sun upon the dry ground, and darkness has passed away
586 And there will be ceaseless light, and to a limit of days, they will not
come, for darkness will have been destroyed previously And the light will
endure in front of the Lord of Spirits, and the light of uprightness will
endure in front of the Lord of Spirits, forever
601 In the fiftieth year, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the
month of the life of Enoch In that parable, I saw how the Heaven of
Heavens was shaken violently, and the Host of the Most High and the
Angels, a thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, were
extremely disturbed
602 And then I saw the Head of Days sitting on the throne of his glory and
the Angels and righteous were sitting around him
603 And a great trembling seized me, and fear took hold of me, and my
loins collapsed and gave way, and my whole being melted, and I fell upon
my face
604 And the Holy Michael sent another Holy Angel, one of the Holy
Angels, and he raised me; and when he raised me my spirit returned, for I
had been unable to endure the sight of that host, and the disturbance, and
75



the shaking of Heaven
605 And the Holy Michael said to me:
“What sight has disturbed you like this? Until today has the day of His
mercy lasted and He has been merciful and long suffering towards those
who dwell upon the dry ground
606 And when the Day, and the Power, and the Punishment, and the
Judgment come that the Lord of Spirits has prepared for those who worship
the Righteous Judgment, and for those who deny the Righteous Judgment,
and for those who take His name in vain - and that Day has been prepared
For the chosen a covenant, but for the sinners a visitation”
607 And on that day two monsters will be separated from one another, a
female monster whose name is Leviathan, to dwell in the depths of the sea,
above the springs of the waters
608 And the name of the male is Behemoth who occupies with his breast
an immense desert named Dendayn on the east of the Garden where the
chosen and the righteous dwell Where my great-grandfather was received,
who was seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of Spirits made
609 And I asked that other Angel to show me the power of those monsters,
how they were separated on one day, and thrown, one into the depths of the
sea and the other on to the dry ground of the desert
6010 And he said to me: “Son of man, you here wish to know what is
secret”
6024 And the Angel of Peace who was with me, said to me: “These two
monsters, prepared in accordance with the greatness of the Lord, will feed
them that Punishment of the Lord And children will be killed with their
mothers and sons with their fathers
6025 When the punishment of the Lord of Spirits rests upon them it will
remain resting so that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come
in vain upon these Afterwards, the judgment will be according to His
76



mercy and His patience"
611 And in those days, I saw long cords given to those Angels and they
acquired wings for themselves, and flew, and went towards the north
612 And I asked the Angel, saying:
“Why did these take the long cords, and go?” And he said to me: “They
went so that they may measure”
613 And the Angel who went with me, said to me:
“These will bring the measurements of the righteous, and the ropes of the
righteous, to the righteous, that they may rely on the name of the Lord of
Spirits for ever and ever
614 The chosen will begin to dwell with the chosen, and these
measurements will be given to faith, and will strengthen righteousness
615 And these measurements will reveal all the secrets of the depths of the
Earth, and those who were destroyed by the desert, and those who were
devoured by the fish of the sea, and by animals, that they may return and
rely on the Day of the Chosen One For no one will be destroyed in front
of the Lord of Spirits, and no one can be destroyed”
616 And all those in the Heavens above received a command, and power,
and one voice, and one light like fire was given to them
617 And Him, before everything, they blessed, and exalted, and praised in
wisdom And they showed themselves wise in speech and in the spirit of
life
618 And the Lord of Spirits set the Chosen One on the throne of his glory,
and he will judge all the works of the Holy ones in Heaven above, and in
the Balance he will weigh their deeds
619 And when he lifts his face to judge their secret ways according to the
word of the name of the Lord of Spirits, and their path according to the way
of the Righteous Judgment of the Lord Most High, they will all speak with
one voice and bless, and praise, and exalt, and glorify, the Name of the
77



Lord of Spirits
6110 And he will call all the Host of the Heavens and all the Holy Ones
above, and the Host of the Lord, the Cherubim, and the Seraphim, and the
Ophannim, and all the Angels of Power, and all the Angels of the
Principalities, and the Chosen One, and the other host that is upon the dry
ground, and over the water, on that Day
6111 And they will raise one voice, and will bless, and praise, and glorify,
and exalt, in the spirit of faith, and in the spirit of wisdom, and of patience,
and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of justice, and of peace, and in
the spirit of goodness And they will all say with one voice: “Blessed is
He, and blessed be the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever”
6112 All Those Who Do Not Sleep in Heaven above will bless him All
His Holy Ones who are in Heaven, will bless Him, and all the chosen ones
who dwell in the Garden of Life, and every spirit able to bless, and praise
and exalt, and hallow your Holy Name And all flesh which to the limit of
its power, will praise, and bless, your Name forever and ever
6113 For great is the mercy of the Lord of Spirits, and he is long-suffering;
and all his works and all his forces, as many as he has made, he has
revealed to the righteous and the chosen, in the Name of the Lord of Spirits
621 And thus the Lord commanded the kings, and the mighty and the
exalted, and those who dwell upon the earth, and said: “Open your eyes
and raise your horns if you are able to acknowledge the Chosen One”
622 And the Lord of Spirits sat on His Throne of Glory, and the spirit of
righteousness was poured out on him, and the word of his mouth kills all
the sinners and all the lawless, and they are destroyed in front of him
623 And on that Day, all the kings and the mighty and the exalted, and
those who possess the earth, will stand up and they will see and recognize
how he sits on the Throne of His Glory And the righteous are judged in
righteousness, in front of him, and no idle word is spoken in front of him
78



624 And pain will come upon them as upon a woman in labour, for whom
giving birth is difficult when her child enters the mouth of the womb, and
she has difficulty giving birth
625 And one half of them will look at the other, and they will be terrified,
and will cast down their faces, and pain will take hold of them when they
see that son of a woman sitting on the throne of His Glory
626 And the mighty kings, and all those who possess the earth, will praise
and bless and exalt Him who rules everything that is hidden
627 For from the beginning that Son of Man was hidden, and the Most
High kept him in the presence of His power, and revealed him only to the
chosen
628 And the community of the Holy and the chosen will be sown and all
the chosen will stand before him on that day
629 And all the mighty kings, and the exalted, and those who rule the dry
ground, will fall down before him, on their faces, and worship; and they
will set their hopes on that Son of Man, and will entreat him, and will
petition for mercy from him
6210 But the Lord of Spirits will then so press them that they will hasten
to go out from before Him, and their faces will be filled with shame, and
the darkness will grow deeper on their faces
6211 And the Angels of Punishment will take them so that they may repay
them for the wrong that they did to His children and to His chosen ones
6212 And they will become a spectacle to the righteous and to His chosen
ones; they will rejoice over them, for the anger of the Lord of Spirits will
rest upon them, and the sword of the Lord of Spirits will be drunk with
them
6213 And the righteous and the chosen will be saved on that Day and they
will never see the faces of the sinners and the lawless from then on
6214 And the Lord of Spirits will remain over them and with that Son of
79



Man they will dwell, and eat, and lie down, and rise up, forever and ever
6215 And the righteous and chosen will have risen from the earth, and will
have ceased to cast down their faces, and will have put on the Garment of
Life
6216 And this will be a Garment of Life from the Lord of Spirits; and your
garments will not wear out, and your glory will not fail, in front of the Lord
of Spirits
631 In those days, the mighty kings who possess the dry ground will
entreat the Angels of His Punishment to whom they have been handed over
so that they might give them a little respite And so that they might fall
down and worship in front of the Lord of Spirits, and confess their sins in
front of Him
632 And they will bless and praise the Lord of Spirits, and say: “Blessed
be the Lord of Spirits, and the Lord of Kings, the Lord of the Mighty, and
the Lord of the Rich, and the Lord of Glory, and the Lord of Wisdom!
633 And everything secret is clear, in front of You, and your power is for
all generations, and your glory is forever and ever Deep and without
number are all your secrets and your righteousness is beyond reckoning
634 Now we realize that we ought to praise and bless the Lord of Kings
and the one who is King over all Kings”
635 And they will say: “Would that we might be given a respite, so that
we might praise and thank and bless him, and make our confession in front
of His Glory
636 And now we long for a respite, but do not find it; we are driven off
and do not obtain it; and the light has passed away from before us, and
darkness will be our dwelling forever and ever
637 For we have not made our confession before him, and we have not
praised the name of the Lord of Kings, and we have not praised the Lord
for all his works, but our hopes have been on the sceptre of our kingdom,
80



and of our glory
638 And on the day of our affliction and distress he does not save us, and
we find no respite to make our confession that our Lord is faithful in all his
doings, and in all his judgments and his justice, and that his judgments
show no respect for persons
639 And we pass away from in front of him because of all our works and
all our sins have been counted exactly”
6310 Then they will say to them: “Our souls are sated with possessions
gained through iniquity, but they do not prevent our going down into the
flames of the torment of Sheol”
6311 And after this their faces will be filled with darkness and shame, in
front of that Son of Man, and they will be driven away from him And the
sword will dwell among them - in front of Him
6312 And thus says the Lord of Spirits: “This is the Law and the
Judgment for the mighty, and the kings, and the exalted, and for those who
possess the dry ground, in front of the Lord of Spirits”
641 And I saw other figures hidden in that place
642 I heard the voice of the Angel saying: “These are the Angels who
came down from Heaven onto the Earth and revealed what is secret to the
sons of men, and led astray the sons of men, so that they committed sin”
682 And on that day the Holy Michael answered Raphael, saying: “The
power of the spirit seizes me and makes me tremble because of the
harshness of the judgment of the Angels Who can endure the harshness of
the judgment which has been executed and before which they melt with
fear?”
683 And the Holy Michael answered Raphael again, and said to him:
“Who would not soften his heart over it, and whose mind would not be
disturbed by this word? Judgment has gone out against them, upon those
whom they have led out like this”
81



684 But it came to pass, when he stood before the Lord of Spirits, that the
Holy Michael spoke as follows to Raphael: “I will not take their part under
the eye of the Lord, for the Lord of Spirits is angry with them, because they
act as if they were the Lord
685 Because of this the hidden judgment will come upon them for ever and
ever; for neither any other Angel, nor any man, will receive their lot, but
they alone have received their judgment for ever and ever
691 And after this judgment I will terrify them, and make them tremble,
for they have shown this to those who dwell upon the dry ground”
692 And behold, the names of those Angels: - The first of them is
Semyaza, and the second Artaqifa, and the third Armen, and the fourth
Kokabiel, and the fifth Turiel, and the sixth Ramiel, and the seventh Daniel,
and the eighth Nuqael, and the ninth Baraqiel, and the tenth Azazel, and the
eleventh Armaros, the twelfth Batriel, the thirteenth Basasael, the
fourteenth Ananel, the fifteenth Turiel, the sixteenth Samsiel, the
seventeenth Yetarel, the eighteenth Tumiel, the nineteenth Turiel, the
twentieth Rumiel, the twenty-first Azazel
693 And these are the chiefs of their Angels, and the names of the leaders
of hundreds, and their leaders of fifties, and their leaders of tens
694 The name of the first is Yequn; this is the one who led astray all the
children of the Holy Angels, and he brought them down onto the dry
ground, and led them astray through the daughters of men
695 And the name of the second is Asbeel; this one suggested an evil plan
to the children of the Holy Angels, and led them astray, so that they
corrupted their bodies with the daughters of men
696 And the name of the third is Gadreel; this is the one that showed all
the deadly blows to the sons of men And he led astray Eve And he
showed the weapons of death to the children of men, the shield and the
breastplate, and the sword for slaughter, and all the weapons of death to the
82



sons of men
697 And from his hand they have gone out against those who dwell the dry
ground from that time and forever and ever
698 And the name of the fourth is Penemue; this one showed the sons of
men the bitter and the sweet and showed them all the secrets of their
wisdom
699 He taught men the art of writing with ink and paper, and through this
many have gone astray, from eternity to eternity, and to this day
6910 For men were not created for this, that they should confirm their faith
like this, with pen and ink
6911 For men were created no differently from the Angels, so that they
might remain righteous and pure, and death, which destroys everything,
would not have touched them; but through this knowledge of theirs they are
being destroyed and through this power death consumes them
6912 And the name of the fifth is Kasdeyae; this one showed the sons of
men all the evil blows of the spirits and of the demons, and the blows that
attack the embryo in the womb so that it miscarries And the blows that
attack the soul: the bite of the serpent And the blows that occur at midday,
and the son of the serpent - who is strong
6913 And this is the task of Kesbeel, the chief of the oath, who showed the
oath to the Holy ones when he dwelt on high in glory And his name is
Beqa
6914 And this one told the Holy Michael that he should show him the
secret name so that they might mention it in the oath, so that those, who
showed the sons of men everything that is secret, trembled before that
name and oath
6915 And this is the power of this oath, for it is powerful and strong, and
he placed this oath, Akae, in the charge of the Holy Michael
6916 And these are the secrets of this oath, and they are strong through this
83



oath, and Heaven was suspended, before the world was created, and
forever
6917 And through it the earth was founded upon the water, and from the
hidden recesses of the mountains come beautiful waters, from the creation
of the world and for ever
6918 And through that oath the sea was created, and as its foundation, for
the time of anger, he placed for it the sand, and it does not go beyond it,
from the creation of the world and for ever
6919 And through that oath the deeps were made firm, and they stand and
do not move from their place, from the creation of the world and for ever
6920 And through that oath the Sun and the Moon complete their course
and do not transgress their command, from the creation of the world and for
ever
6921 And through that oath the stars complete their course, and he calls
their names, and they answer him, from the creation of the world and for
ever
6922 And likewise the spirits of the water, of the winds, and of all the
breezes, and their paths, according to all the groups of the spirits
6923 And there are kept the storehouses of the sound of thunder, and of the
light of the lightning; and there are kept the storehouses of the hail, and the
hoarfrost, and the storehouses of the mist, and the storehouses of the rain
and dew
6924 And all these make their confession and give thanks in front of the
Lord of Spirits and sing praises with all their power And their food
consists of all their thanksgiving and they give thanks, praise, and exalt, in
the name of the Lord of Spirits, forever and ever
6925 And this oath is strong over them and through it they are kept safe
and their courses are not disturbed
6926 And they had great joy and they blessed, praised, and exalted, because the name of that Son of Man had been revealed to them
6927 And he sat on the Throne of His Glory and the whole judgment was
given to the Son of Man and he will cause the sinners to pass away and be
destroyed from the face of the Earth
6928 And those who led astray the world will be bound in chains and will
be shut up in the assembly-place of their destruction, and all their works
will pass away from the face of the earth
6929 And from then on there will be nothing corruptible For that Son of
Man has appeared, and has sat on the Throne of His Glory, and everything
evil will pass away and go from in front of Him; and the word of that Son
of Man will be strong in front of the Lord of Spirits
This is the Third Parable of Enoch

Notes Start: (13) THE STOREHOUSES (pages 87-90)
Enoch often mentions storehouses throughout the book Storehouses were
probably first introduced to Enoch's people by the runaways Since they were
considered as angels their storehouses were probably considered divine and magical
Many people probably believed that the storehouses created the goods that were stored
inside them Enoch probably knew better than that since he may have been the keeper of
records and inventories However, he does seem to regard storehouses as basic to God's
way of distributing natural things such as the weather
At the beginning he again describes his journey (702-3) - he was lifted on a
chariot of the spirit and they went northwest I assume this is some kind of flying
machine today we would probably call it a UFO rather than a chariot of the spirit
Enoch goes on to describe the land of the angels and a meeting with the Head of
Days Four of the Watchers are named at 719; they may have been assigned to look
after Enoch because they could speak his language well
Enoch seems to have asked questions and made some notes, and this section,
and the next section, and "the Law of the Stars" is the result My opinion is that the
Watchers knew the answers to Enoch's questions but it was difficult for them to explain
the answers to Enoch in terms that he could understand
This is shown clearly at 6014 and 6015 where Enoch reports an explanation of
thunder and lightning and why you see the flash before you hear the bang This is
common knowledge now - but not to Enoch I think that Enoch believed, initially, that
the bangs and flashes occurred separately made by different processes He reports that
they are not separate although not the same, 6014, because a spirit makes them
inseparable Since Enoch assumes that you see and hear things at the instant they
happen he finds it hard to understand why the sound has to wait and so brings a
storehouse into the explanation
Notes END: (13) THE STOREHOUSES 
13) THE STOREHOUSES
701 And it came to pass, after this, that while he was living his name was
lifted from those who dwell upon the dry ground to the presence of that
Son of Man, and to the presence of the Lord of Spirits
702 And he was lifted on the chariots of the spirit, and his name vanished
from among them
703 And from that day I was not counted among them, and He placed me
between two winds, between the north and the west, where the Angels took
the cords to measure for me the place for the chosen and the righteous
704 And there I saw the First Fathers and the righteous who from the
beginning of the world dwelt in that place
711 And it came to pass, after this, that my spirit was carried off, and it
went up into the Heavens I saw the sons of the Holy Angels treading upon
flames of fire their garments were white, and their clothing, and the light of
their face, was like snow
712 And I saw two rivers of fire, and the light of that fire shone like a
hyacinth, and I fell upon my face in front of the Lord of Spirits
713 And the Angel Michael, one of the Archangels, took hold of me by my
right hand, and raised me and led me out to all the secrets of mercy, and the
secrets of righteousness
714 And he showed me all the secrets of the Ends of Heaven and all the
Storehouses of the Stars and the Lights from where they come out from
below the Holy Ones
715 And the Spirit carried Enoch off to the Highest Heaven, and I saw
there, in the middle of that Light, something built of crystal stones, and in
the middle of those stones tongues of living fire
716 And my spirit saw a circle of fire, which surrounded that house; from
its four sides came rivers, full of living fire, and they surrounded that
87



house
717 And round about were the Seraphim and the Cherubim, and the
Ophannim; these are They Who Do Not Sleep but keep watch over the
Throne of His Glory
718 And I saw Angels, who could not be counted, a thousand thousands
and ten thousand times ten thousand, surrounding that house And
Michael, and Raphael, and Gabriel, and Phanuel, and the Holy Angels who
are in the Heavens above, went in and out of that house
719 And Michael, and Raphael, and Gabriel, and Phanuel, and many Holy
Angels without number, came out from that house
7110 And with them the Head of Days, his head white, and pure, like wool
and his garments - indescribable
7111 And I fell upon my face, and my whole body melted, and my spirit
was transformed; and I cried out in a loud voice, in the spirit of power, and
I blessed, praised, and exalted
7112 And these blessings, which came out from my mouth, were pleasing
before that Head of Days
7113 And that Head of Days came with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and
Phanuel, and thousands and tens of thousands of Angels without number
7114 And that Angel, came to me, and greeted me with his voice, and said
to me: “You are the son of man who was born to righteousness and
righteousness remains over you and the righteousness of the Head of Days,
will not leave you”
7115 And he said to me: “He proclaims peace to you in the name of the
world which is to come, for from there peace has come out from the
creation of the world and so you will have it for ever and for ever and ever
7116 And all will walk according to your way, inasmuch as righteousness
will never leave you With you will be their dwelling, and with you their
lot, and they will not be separated from you for ever and for ever and ever
88



7117 And so there will be length of days with that Son of Man, and the
righteous will have peace, and the righteous will have an upright way in the
name of the Lord of Spirits, for ever and ever”
591 And in those days my eyes saw the secrets of the flashes of lightning,
and the lights, and the regulations governing them; and they flash for a
blessing or a curse, as the Lord of Spirits wishes
592 And there I saw the secrets of the thunder and how when it crashes in
Heaven above the sound of it is heard And they showed me the dwellings
of the dry ground, and the sound of the thunder, for peace, and for blessing,
or for a curse, according to the word of the Lord of Spirits
593 And after this all the secrets of the lights, and of the flashes of
lightning, were shown to me They flash to bring blessing and satisfaction
6011 And the other Angel spoke to me, the one who went with me and
showed me what is secret; what is first and last in Heaven, in the heights,
and under the dry ground, in the depths, and at the Ends of Heaven, and at
the Foundations of Heaven, and in the Storehouses of the Winds
6012 And how the spirits are distributed, and how they are weighed And
how the springs, and the winds, are counted according to the power of their
spirit And the power of the light of the Moon And the divisions of the
stars according to their names And how all the divisions are made
6013 And the thunder - according to the places were it falls And all the
divisions that are made in lightning - so that it may flash And its hosts how they quickly obey
6014 For the thunder have fixed intervals, which have been given to its
sound, for waiting And the thunder and the lightning are not separate
although not the same Through a spirit the two of them move inseparably
6015 For when the lightning flashes the thunder utters its voice, and the
spirit, at the proper time, causes it to rest, and divides equally between them
because the storehouse of the times for their occurrence is like that of the
89



sand And each of them, at the proper time, is held by a rein, and turned
back by the power of the spirit, and likewise driven forward, according to
the number of the regions of the Earth
6016 And the spirit of the sea is male and strong, and according to the
power of its strength, the spirit turns it back with a rein, and likewise it is
driven forward, and scattered amongst all the mountains of the Earth
6017 And the spirit of the hoarfrost is its own Angel; and the spirit of the
hail, is a good Angel
6018 And the spirit of the snow has withdrawn because of its power, and it
has a special spirit, and that which rises from it is like smoke and its name
is frost
6019 And the spirit of the mist is not associated with them in their
storehouse but has a special storehouse; for its course is glorious both in
light and darkness, and in winter and in summer, and its storehouse is an
Angel
6020 The spirit of the dew has its dwelling at the ends of Heaven and is
connected with the storehouses of the rain And its course is in winter and
in summer and its clouds And the clouds of the mist are associated and
one gives to the other
6021 And when the spirit of the rain moves from its storehouse the Angels
come and open the storehouse and bring it out And when it is scattered
over all the dry ground it joins with all the water that is on the dry ground
And whenever it joins with the water that is on the dry ground(…)
6022 For the waters are for those who dwell upon the dry ground, for they
are nourishment for the dry ground, from the Most High who is in Heaven
Therefore there is a fixed measure for the rain and the Angels comprehend
it
6023 All these things, I saw towards the Garden of Righteousness
Notes Start: (14) THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE LIGHTS (pages 93-105)
This chapter explains the path of the Sun in the sky, and how the length of the
day varies, and the different seasons The division of the year into months and the
phases of the Moon are explained here
It is interesting that the variation of day length is described with the day divided
into 18 parts The Watchers may have divided the day into 18 "hours" rather than our 24-hour system
The seasonal variation in day length described, see 7214 & 7226, is more
typical of northern latitudes The situation here in London, in late December (close to
the mid-winter solstice), is very similar to the description at 7226 with a day of 8 hours,
and a night of 16 hours
The section on the Moon contains some accurate information such as that it
appears in the sky to be the same size as the Sun, 7237
At 758-9 Enoch explains how the axis of rotation passes through the middle of
the Earth - although I think Enoch was not sure what Uriel means by this It should be
remembered that the fact that the Earth is spherical and rotating was only widely
accepted a few hundred years ago Before then it was believed that the Sun went round
the Earth There is a book called ‘Uriel’s Machine’ by C Knight and Robert Lomas that
makes out a good case for this chapter containing the information needed to construct a
‘henge’ - an observatory made from posts or standing stones They also suggest Enoch
may have been taken to Ireland - where there are a number of unusual and ancient sites
still surviving
When Enoch is talking about the north, at 773, he mentions this is the location
of the Garden of Righteousness - the homeland of the Watchers
At 784, the fact that the Moon obtains its light from the Sun is revealed At
7817 he says the Moon has a face ("looks like a man") for 20 days in the month; we
call him "the man in the Moon" This is more evidence against my theory about the
South Sandwich islands being the home of the Watchers because the Moon’s face is not
recognizable in the southern hemisphere (because it is upside down) I suspect that this
section about the Moon should be elsewhere in the text, probably near to the previous
section about the Moon a few pages before
There is a description of a book written by the Watchers that Enoch took notes
from, (see 811-2), Enoch calls it The Tablets of Heaven Enoch’s prophecy chapters
come from this book
Notes End: (14) THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE LIGHTS 
14) THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE LIGHTS
721 The Book of the Revolutions of the Lights of Heaven Each as it is; according to their classes, according to their period of rule and their times, according to their names and places of origin, and according to their months That Uriel, the Holy Angel who was with me, and is their leader, showed to me And he showed me all their regulations, exactly as they are, for each year of the world and for ever, until the new creation shall be made which will last forever
722 And this is the First Law of the Lights The light called the Sun; its rising is in the Gates of Heaven that are towards the east, and its setting is in the western Gates of Heaven
723 And I saw six Gates from which the Sun rises, and six Gates in which the Sun sets, and the Moon also rises and sets in those Gates, and the leaders of the stars together with those whom they lead There are six in the east and six in the west, all exactly in place, one next to the other; and there are many windows to the south and the north of those Gates
724 And first there rises the greater light, named the Sun, and its disc is like the disc of Heaven, and the whole of it is full of a fire which gives light and warmth
725 The wind blows the chariots on which it ascends, and the Sun goes down in the sky and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is led so that it comes to the appropriate Gate and shines in the sky
726 In this way it rises in the first month, in the large Gate, namely; it rises through the fourth of those six Gates that are towards the east
727 And in that fourth Gate, through which the Sun rises in the first month, there are twelve window-openings from which, whenever they are opened, flames come out
728 When the Sun rises in Heaven it goes out through that fourth Gate for thirty days, and exactly in the fourth Gate, in the west of Heaven, it goes down
729 And in those days the day grows daily longer, and the night grows nightly shorter, until the thirtieth morning
7210 And on that day the day becomes longer than the night by a double part, and the day amounts to exactly ten parts, and the night amounts to eight parts
7211 And the Sun rises from that fourth Gate, and sets in the fourth Gate, and returns to the fifth Gate in the east for thirty mornings; and it rises from it and sets in the fifth Gate
7212 And then the day becomes longer by two parts, and the day amounts
to eleven parts, and the night becomes shorter and amounts to seven parts
7213 And the Sun returns to the east and comes to the sixth Gate, and rises
and sets in the sixth Gate for thirty-one mornings, because of its sign
7214 And on that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day
becomes double the night; and the day amounts to twelve parts, and the
night becomes shorter and amounts to six parts
7215 And the Sun rises up so that the day may grow shorter, and the night
longer; and the Sun returns to the east, and comes to the sixth Gate, and
rises from it, and sets, for thirty mornings
7216 And when thirty mornings have been completed the day becomes
shorter, by exactly one part; and the day amounts to eleven parts, and the
night to seven parts
7217 And the Sun goes out from the west, through that sixth Gate, and
goes to the east, and rises in the fifth Gate for thirty mornings and it sets in
the west again, in the fifth Gate in the west
7218 On that day the day becomes shorter by two parts, and the day
amounts to ten parts, and the night to eight parts
7219 And the Sun rises from that fifth Gate, and sets in the fifth Gate in
the west, and rises in the fourth Gate for thirty-one mornings because of its
sign, and sets in the west
7220 On that day the day becomes equal with the night, and is of equal
length; and the night amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts
7221 And the Sun rises from that Gate and sets in the west, and returns to
the east, and rises in the third Gate for thirty mornings, and sets in the west
in the third Gate
7222 And the Sun rises from that third Gate, and sets in the third Gate in
the west, and returns to the east; and the Sun rises in the second Gate in the
east for thirty mornings, and likewise, it sets in the second Gate, in the west
of Heaven
7224 And on that day the night amounts to eleven parts and the day to
seven parts
7225 And the Sun rises, on that day, from the second Gate, and sets in the
west in the second Gate, and returns to the east to the first Gate for thirtyone mornings, then sets in the west in the first Gate
7226 And on that day the night becomes longer, and becomes double the
day; and the night amounts to exactly twelve parts, and the day to six parts
7227 And with this, the Sun has completed the divisions of its journey, and
it turns back again, along these divisions of its journey; and it comes
through that first Gate for thirty mornings, and sets in the west opposite it
7228 And on that day the night becomes shorter in length by one part, and
amounts to eleven parts, and the day to seven parts
7229 And the Sun returns, and comes to the second Gate in the east, and it
returns along those divisions of its journey for thirty mornings, rising and
setting
7230 And on that day the night becomes shorter in length and the night
amounts to ten parts and the day to eight parts
7231 And on that day, the Sun rises from the second Gate, and sets in the
west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third Gate for thirty one
mornings, and sets in the west of the sky
7232 And on that day the night becomes shorter, and amounts to nine
parts, and the day amounts to nine parts, and the night becomes equal with
the day And the year amounts to exactly 364 days
7233 And the length of the day and the night, and the shortness of the day
and the night - they are different because of the journey of the Sun
7234 Because of it, its journey becomes daily longer, and nightly shorter
7235 And this is the law and the journey of the Sun and its return, as often
as it returns; sixty times it returns and rises, that is the great eternal light,
which for ever and ever is named the Sun
7236 And this that rises is the great light, which is named after its
appearance, as the Lord commanded
7237 And thus it rises and sets; it neither decreases, nor rests, but runs day
and night in its chariot And its light is seven times brighter than that of the
Moon but in size the two are equal
731 And after this law I saw another law, for the lesser light, named the
Moon
732 And its disc is like the disc of the Sun, and the wind blows its chariot
on which it rides, and in fixed measure light is given to it
733 And every month it’s rising and setting change, and its days are as the
days of the Sun, and when its light is uniformly full, it is a seventh part the
light of the Sun
734 And thus it rises, and its first phase is towards the east; it rises on the
thirtieth morning And on that day it appears, and becomes for you the first
phase of the Moon, on the thirtieth morning, together with the Sun in the
Gate through which the Sun rises
735 And a half(…) with a seventh part, and its entire disc is empty,
without light, except for a seventh part, a fourteenth part of it’s light
736 And on the day that it receives a seventh part and a half of its light, its
light amounts to a seventh, and a seventh part and a half
737 It sets with the Sun, and when the Sun rises, the Moon rises with it,
and receives a half of one part of light And on that night at the beginning
of its morning, at the beginning of the Moon's day, the Moon sets with the
Sun, and is dark on that night in six and seven parts and a half
738 And it rises on that day, with exactly a seventh part, goes out, recedes
from the rising of the Sun, and becomes bright on the remainder of its days,
in the other six and seven parts
741 And another journey, and law, I saw for it, in that according to this
law it makes its monthly journey
742 And Uriel, the Holy Angel who is leader of them all, showed me
everything, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me
And I wrote down their months, as they are, and the appearance of their
light, until fifteen days have been completed
743 In seventh parts it makes all its darkness full, and in seventh parts it
makes all its light full, in the east and in the west
744 And in certain months, it changes its setting, and in certain months, it
follows its own individual course
745 In two months it sets with the Sun, in those two Gates that are in the
middle, in the third and in the fourth Gate
746 It goes out for seven days and turns back, and returns again to the Gate
from which the Sun rises And in that Gate it makes all its light full, and it
recedes from the Sun, and comes, in eight days, to the sixth Gate from
which the Sun rises
747 And when the Sun rises from the fourth Gate, the Moon goes out for
seven days, until it rises from the fifth Gate And again it returns in seven
days to the fourth Gate, makes all its light full, recedes, and comes to the
first Gate in eight days
748 And again it returns in seven days to the fourth Gate from which the
Sun rises
749 Thus I saw their positions; how the Moon rose and the Sun set in those
days
7410 And if five years are added together, the Sun has an excess of thirty
days For each year, of the five years, there are three hundred and sixty
four days
7411 And the excess, of the Sun and the stars, comes to six days In five
years, with six days each, they have an excess of thirty days, and the Moon
falls behind the Sun and the stars by thirty days
7412 And the Moon conducts the years exactly, all of them according to
their eternal positions; they are neither early nor late, even by one day, but
change the year in exactly 364 days
7413 In three years, there are 1,092 days, and in five years 1,820 days, so
that in eight years there are 2,912 days
7414 For the Moon alone, the days in three years come to 1,062 days, and
in five years it is fifty days behind
7415 And there are 1,770 days in five years so that for the Moon the days
in eight years amount to 2,832 days
7416 For the difference in eight years is eighty days, and all the days that
the Moon is behind, in eight years, are eighty days
7417 And the year is completed exactly, in accordance with their positions,
and the positions of the Sun, in that they rise from the Gates from which
the Sun rises and sets for thirty days
751 And the leaders of the tens of thousands, who are in charge of the
whole of creation, and in charge of all the stars, and also the four days
which are added, and are not separated from their position, according to the
whole reckoning of the year And these serve on the four days that are not
counted in the reckoning of the year
752 And because of them men go wrong in them For these lights really
serve in the stations of the world, one in the first Gate, and one in the third
Gate, and one in the fourth Gate, and one in the sixth Gate And the exact
harmony of the world is completed in the separate 364 stations of the
world
753 For the signs, and the times, and the years, and the days, were showed
to me by the Angel Uriel whom the Lord of Eternal Glory has placed in
charge of all the Lights of Heaven In Heaven and in the world, so that
they might rule on the Face of Heaven, and appear over the earth, and be
leaders of day and night; the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and all the serving
creatures who revolve in all the Chariots of Heaven
754 Likewise, Uriel showed to me twelve Gate-openings in the disc of the
chariot of the Sun, in the sky, from which the rays of the Sun come out
And from them heat comes out over the Earth when they are opened at the
times that are appointed for them
755 And there are openings for the winds, and for the spirit of the dew,
when they are opened at their times, opened in Heaven, at the ends of the
earth
756 I saw twelve Gates in Heaven, at the ends of the earth, from which the
Sun, and the Moon, and the stars, and all the works of Heaven, go out in
the east and in the west
757 And there are many window-openings to the north and to the south,
and each window, at its appointed time, sends out heat corresponding to
those Gates, from which the stars go out, in accordance with His command
to them, and in which they set according to their number
758 And I saw chariots in Heaven, running through the region above those
Gates, in which the stars that never set rotate
759 And one is bigger than all the others And it goes round through the
whole world
761 And at the ends of the earth, I saw twelve Gates open to all the winds,
from which the winds come out and blow over the earth
762 Three of them open in the front of Heaven, and three in the back, and
three on the right of Heaven, and three on the left
763 And the three first are those towards the east, and then the three
towards the north, and the three after these towards the south, and the three
in the west
764 Through four of them come winds of blessing and peace And from
the other eight come winds of punishment; when they are sent they bring
devastation to the whole Earth, and to the water which is on it, and to all
those who dwell upon it, and to everything that is in the water and on dry
ground
765 And the first wind from those Gates, called the east wind, comes out
through the first Gate, which is towards the east The one that comes from
the south brings devastation, drought, heat, and destruction
766 And through the second Gate, in the middle, comes what is right And
from it come rain, and fruitfulness, and prosperity, and dew And through
the third Gate, which is towards the north, comes cold and drought
767 And after these, the winds towards the south come out, through three
Gates First, through the first of the Gates, which inclines towards the east,
comes a hot wind
768 And through the middle Gate, which is next to it, come pleasant
fragrances, and dew, and rain, and prosperity, and life
769 And through the third Gate, which is towards the west, come dew, and
rain, and locusts, and devastation
7610 And after these, the winds towards the north(…)from the seventh
Gate, which is towards the east, come dew and rain, locusts and
devastation
7611 And through the Gate exactly in the middle, come rain, and dew, and
life, and prosperity And through the third Gate, which is towards the west
come mist and hoarfrost, and snow, and rain, and dew, and locusts
7612 And after these the winds towards the west Through the first Gate,
which inclines towards the north, come dew, and rain, and hoarfrost, and
cold, and snow, and frost
7613 And from the middle Gate, come dew and rain, prosperity and
blessing And through the last Gate, which is towards the south, come
drought and devastation, burning and destruction
7614 And thus the twelve Gates, of the four quarters of Heaven are
complete And all their laws, and all their punishments, and all their
benefits, I have shown to you, my son Methuselah
771 They called the first quarter eastern because it is the first, and they call
the second the south because there the Most High descends, and there
especially the one who is blessed forever descends
772 And the western quarter is called waning because there all the lights of
Heaven wane and go down
773 And the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three parts
And the first of them is the dwelling place for men; and the second contains
seas of water, and the deeps, and the forests, and rivers, and darkness and
mist; and the third part contains the Garden of Righteousness
774 I saw seven high mountains, which were higher than all other
mountains on the earth; and from them snow comes And days and times
and years, pass away and go by
775 I saw seven rivers on the earth, larger than all the other rivers; one of
them comes from the east and pours out its waters into the Great Sea
776 And two of them come from the north to the sea and pour out their
water into the Erythraean Sea in the east
777 And the remaining four flow out on the side of the north, to their seas,
two to the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea, and they discharge
themselves there, and not into the wilderness, as some say
778 I saw seven large islands, in the sea and on the land, two on the land,
and five in the Great Sea
781 The names of the Sun are as follows: The first Oryares, and the
second Tomases
782 The Moon has four names: The first name is Asonya, and the second
Ebla, and the third Benase, and the fourth Era'e
783 These are the two great lights; their disc is like the disc of Heaven and
in size the two are equal
784 In the disc of the Sun, are seven parts of light, which are added to it
more than to the Moon, and in fixed measure light is transferred to the
Moon until a seventh part of the Sun is exhausted
785 And they set, go into the Gates of the west, go round through the
north, and rise through the Gates of the east, on the face of Heaven
786 And when the Moon rises, it appears in the sky, and has a half of a
seventh part of light, and on the fourteenth day it makes all its light full
787 And fifteen parts of light are transferred to it, until on the fifteenth day
its light is full, according to the sign of the year, and amounts to fifteen
parts And the Moon comes into being by halves of a seventh part
788 And in its waning on the first day, it decreases to fourteen parts of its
light And on the second to thirteen parts, and on the third to twelve parts,
on the fourth to eleven parts, and on the fifth to ten parts, and on the sixth
to nine parts, and on the seventh to eight parts, and on the eighth to seven
parts, and on the ninth to six parts, and on the tenth to five parts, and on the
eleventh to four parts, and on the twelfth to three, and on the thirteenth to
two, and on the fourteenth to half of a seventh part And all the light that
remains from the total disappears on the fifteenth day
789 And in certain months the Moon has twenty-nine days and once
twenty-eight
7810 And Uriel showed me another law: - when light is transferred to the
Moon, and on which side it is transferred from the Sun
7811 All the time that the Moon is increasing in its light, it transfers as it
becomes opposite the Sun, until in fourteen days it’s light is full in the sky;
and when it is all ablaze, it’s light is full in the sky
7812 And on the first day it is called the New Moon, for on that, daylight
rises on it
7813 And its light becomes full exactly on the day that as the Sun goes
down in the west it rises from the east for the night And the Moon shines
for the whole night until the Sun rises opposite it, and the Moon is seen
opposite the Sun
7814 And on the side on which the light of the Moon appears, there again
it wanes, until all its light disappears, and the days of the Moon end and its
disc remains empty without light
7815 And for three months, at its proper time, it achieves thirty days, and
for three months, it achieves twenty-nine days, during which it completes
its waning, in the first period, in the first Gate, 127 days
7816 And in the time of it’s rising, for three months, it appears in each
month with thirty days And for three months it appears in each month
with twenty-nine days
7817 By night, for twenty days each time, it looks like a man, and by day
like Heaven, for there is nothing else in it except it’s light
791 And now, my son Methuselah, I have shown you everything, and the
whole Law of the Stars of Heaven is complete
792 And he showed me the whole law for these, for every day, and for
every time, and for every rule, and for every year, and for the end thereof,
according to its command, for every month and every week
793 And the waning of the Moon, which occurs in the sixth Gate, for in
that sixth Gate it’s light becomes full, and after that it is the beginning of the month
794 And the waning, which occurs in the first Gate, at its proper time, until
127 days are complete, or by weeks; twenty-five weeks and two days
795 And how it falls behind the Sun, according to the law of the stars, by
exactly five days in one period of time, when it has completed the pathway
you have seen
796 Such is the appearance, and likeness, of every light, which Uriel, the
great Angel who is their leader, showed to me
801 And in those days Uriel answered me and said to me: “Behold, I have
shown you everything, Oh Enoch And I have revealed everything to you,
so that you may see this Sun, and this Moon, and those who lead the Stars
of Heaven, and all those who turn them, their tasks and their times and their
rising
802 But in the days of the sinners the years will become shorter, and their
seed will be late on their land, and on their fields And all things on the
earth will change and will not appear at their proper time And the rain will
be withheld and Heaven will retain it
803 And in those times the fruits of the earth will be late, and will not
grow at their proper time, and the fruits of the trees will be withheld at their
proper time
804 And the Moon will change its customary practice and will not appear
at its proper time
805 But in those days it will appear in Heaven, come on top of a large
chariot in the west, and shine with more than normal brightness
806 And many heads of the stars, in command, will go astray And these
will change their courses and their activities and will not appear at the
times that have been prescribed for them
807 And the entire law of the stars will be closed to the sinners, and the
thoughts of those who dwell upon the Earth will go astray over them, and
they will turn from all their ways and will go astray, and will think them
gods
808 And many evils will overtake them and punishment will come upon
them to destroy them all”
811 And he said to me: “Oh Enoch, look at the book of the Tablets of
Heaven and read what is written upon them, and note every individual
fact”
812 And I looked at everything that was written and I noted everything
And I read the book and everything that was written in it, all the deeds of
men, and all the children of flesh who will be upon the Earth, for all the
generations of eternity
813 And then I immediately blessed the Lord, the Eternal King of Glory,
in that he has made all the works of the world, and I praised the Lord
because of his patience, and I blessed him on account of the sons of Adam
814 And at that time I said: “Blessed is the man who dies righteous and
good, concerning whom no book of iniquity has been written, and against
whom no guilt has been found”
Notes Start: (15) ENOCH'S LETTER TO METHUSELAH (pages 107-108)
This short section may be in the wrong location It may have been a letter that
Enoch gave to his son, with the book Or it may have originally been at the end of the
book, as a conclusion It stands satisfactorily on its own, so I have kept to the order of
the Ethiopian manuscripts

15) ENOCH'S LETTER TO METHUSELAH
815 And these three Holy ones brought me and set me on the earth in front
of the door of my house, and said to me: “Tell everything to your son
Methuselah, and show all your children that no flesh is righteous, before
the Lord, for He created them
816 For one year we will leave you with your children, until you have
regained your strength, so that you may teach your children and write these
things down for them, and testify to all your children And in the second
year we will take you from amongst them
817 Let your heart be strong, for the good will proclaim righteousness to
the good, the righteous will rejoice with the righteous and they will wish
each other well
818 But the sinner will die with the sinner and the apostate will sink with
the apostate
819 And those who practice righteousness will die because of the deeds of
men, and will be gathered in because of the deeds of the impious”
8110 And in those days they finished speaking to me and I went to my
family as I blessed the Lord of Ages
821 And now, my son Methuselah, all these things I recount to you, and
write down for you I have revealed everything to you, and have given you
books about all these things Keep, my son Methuselah, the books from the
hand of your father so that you may pass them on to the generations of
eternity
822 I have given wisdom to you, and to your children, and to those who
will be your children, that they may give it to their children, for all the
generations, forever, this wisdom that is beyond their thoughts
823 And those who understand it will not sleep, but will incline their ears
that they may learn this wisdom, and it will be better for those who eat from it than good food
Notes Start: (16) THE LAW OF THE STARS (pages 110-112)
This chapter is the conclusion to the part of Enoch's book about astronomy and
the calendar
At 828, Enoch reports that the planets (powers of heaven) rotate in their orbits!
Notes End: (16) THE LAW OF THE STARS
16) THE LAW OF THE STARS
824 Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those who walk in the way
of righteousness and do not sin like the sinners
In the numbering of all their days in which the Sun journeys in Heaven,
coming in and out, through the Gates of Heaven, for thirty days
With the leaders of the thousands, of this order of stars, and with the four
which are added, and divided between the four seasons of the year, which
lead them and appear with them on four days
825 Because of them men go wrong, and they do not reckon them in the
reckoning of the whole year; for men go wrong in respect of them and do
not know them exactly
826 For they belong in the reckoning of the year, and are truly recorded
forever, one in the first Gate, and one in the third, and one in the fourth and
one in the sixth And the year is completed in 364 days
827 And the account of it is true, and the recorded reckoning of it is exact,
for the lights, and the months, and the feasts, and the years, and the days
Uriel showed me, and inspired me; he to whom the Lord of the whole
created world gave commands about the Host of Heaven for me
828 And he has power in Heaven, over night and day, to cause light to
shine on men; the Sun, the Moon, and the stars, and all the Powers of
Heaven, which rotate in their orbits
829 And this is the Law of the Stars, which set in their places, at their
times, and at their feasts, and in their months
8210 And these are the names of those who lead them, who keep watch, so
that they appear at their times, and in their orders, and in their months, and
in their periods of rule, and in their positions
8211 Their four leaders, who divide the four parts of the year, appear first;
and after them the twelve leaders of the orders, who divide the months and
110



the years into 364 days, with the heads over thousands, who separate the
days And for the four days, that are added to them, there are the leaders
who separate the four parts of the year
8212 And as for these heads over thousands, one is added between the
leader and the led, but their leaders make the separation
8213 And these are the names of the leaders who separate the four
appointed parts of the year: Melkiel, Helemmelek, Meleyal, and Narel
8214 And the names of those whom they lead: Adnarel, Iyasusael,
Iylumiel; these three follow behind the leaders of the orders And all others
follow behind the three leaders of the orders, who follow behind those
leaders of positions, who separate the four parts of the year
8215 In the beginning of the year, Melkiel rises first and rules, who is
called the southern Sun - and all the days of his period, during which he
rules, are ninety-one
8216 And these are the signs of the days that are to be seen on the earth, in
the days of his period of rule; sweat, and heat, and calm And all the trees
bear fruit, and leaves appear on all the trees, and the wheat harvest, and
rose flowers And all the flowers bloom in the field but the trees of winter
are withered
8217 And these are the names of the leaders who are under them: Berkeel,
Zelebsael, and another one who is added, a head over a thousand, named
Heloyaseph And the days of the period of rule, of this one, are complete
8218 The second leader, after him, is Helemmelec, whom they call the
Shining Sun; and all the days of his light are ninety-one
8219 And these are the signs of the days on earth: heat, and drought And
the trees bring their fruit to ripeness and maturity and make their fruit dry
And the sheep mate and become pregnant And men gather all the fruits of
the earth, and everything that is in the fields, and the vats of wine And
these things occur in the days of his period of rule
8220 And these are the names, and the orders, and the leaders of these
heads over thousands: Gedaeyal, Keel, and Heel And the name of the
head-over-a-thousand, who is added to them, is Asfael And the days of his
period of rule are complete
Notes Start: (17) ENOCH'S FIRST VISION (pages 114-116)
This chapter serves as a short introduction to the prophecy chapters Enoch
describes a disturbing dream he had when he was young
Notes End: (17) ENOCH'S FIRST VISION 
17) ENOCH'S FIRST VISION
831 And now, my son Methuselah, I will show you all the visions that I saw, recounting them before you
832 Two visions I saw, before I took a wife, and neither one was like the other For the first time, when I learnt the art of writing, and for the second time, before I took your mother I saw a terrible vision and concerning this I made supplication to the Lord
833 I had lain down in the house of my grandfather, Malalel, when I saw in a vision how Heaven was thrown down, and removed, and it fell upon the Earth
834 And when it fell upon the Earth, I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down upon hills, and tall trees were torn up by their roots, and were thrown down, and sank into the abyss
835 And then speech fell into my mouth, and I raised my voice to cry out, and said: “The earth is destroyed!”
836 And my grandfather, Malalel, roused me, since I lay near him, and said to me: “Why did you cry out so, my son, and why do you moan so?”
837 And I recounted to him the whole vision, which I had seen, and he said to me: “A terrible thing you have seen, my son! Your dream vision concerns the secrets of all the sin of the Earth; it is about to sink into the abyss and be utterly destroyed
838 And now, my son, rise and make supplication to the Lord of Glory, for you are faithful, that a remnant may be left on the Earth and that he may not wipe out the whole Earth
839 My son, from Heaven all this will come upon the Earth, and upon the Earth there will be great destruction”
8310 And then I rose and prayed, and made supplication, and wrote my prayer down for the generations of eternity, and I will show everything to you my son Methuselah
8311 And, when I went out below and saw the sky, and the Sun rising in the east, and the Moon setting in the west, and some stars, and the whole Earth, and everything as He knew it since the beginning Then I blessed the Lord of Judgment and ascribed Majesty to him, for he makes the Sun come out from the windows of the east, so that it ascends and rises on the face of Heaven, and follows the path which has been shown to it
841 And I raised my hands in righteousness and I blessed the Holy and Great One And I spoke with the breath of my mouth, and with the tongue of flesh, which God has made for men born of flesh so that they might speak with it; and he has given them breath, and a tongue, and a mouth, so that they might speak with them
842 “Blessed are you, Oh Lord King, and great and powerful in your majesty, Lord of the whole Creation of Heaven, King of Kings, and God of the whole world! And your kingly authority, and your Sovereignty and your Majesty will last forever, and forever and ever, and your power, for all generations And all the Heavens are your throne, forever, and the whole Earth your footstool forever, and ever and ever
843 For you made, and you rule, everything, and nothing is too hard for you, and no wisdom escapes you; it does not turn away from your throne nor from your presence And you know, and see, and hear, everything, and nothing is hidden from you, for you see everything
844 And now the Angels of your Heaven are doing wrong and your anger rests upon the flesh of men until the day of the great judgment
845 And now, Oh God, Lord, and Great King, I entreat and ask that you will fulfill my prayer to leave me a posterity on Earth and not to wipe out all the flesh of men and make the earth empty so that there is destruction forever
846 And now, my Lord, wipe out from the earth the flesh that has
provoked your anger, but the flesh of righteousness and uprightness
establish as a seed bearing plant forever And do not hide your face from
the prayer of your servant, Oh Lord”
Notes Start: (18) PROPHECY OF THE ANIMALS (pages 120-135)
Although Enoch says here that it was a dream this is a long and detailed
prophecy The Watchers may have told him to say it was a dream He has written it in
his own words, his style is easily recognizable, particularly where the story is
complicated. Most of the contents of prophecy are now history and are recognizable as bible
stories but the end stretches off into the future There are no names or dates; different
animals represent different nations or nationalities The next chapter, The Ten Weeks,
covers the same story but from a different viewpoint
We start at 853 with Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel
Cain and his descendants are at 855 At 858 Seth is born to Eve
Next (859-10) there is Enoch's family line
described in Genesis chapter 5
The star at 861 is the first of the Watchers to appear They are represented in
this story by stars rather than as animals – another indication that they were the real
authors or, at least, the editors of this chapter This first one is the fall of Satan, perhaps
a senior member of the Watchers, we don’t seem to have any reliable information on
this story, the information here is that Satan caused people to be dissatisfied, they
moved around and changed their wives
The period covered by Enoch's book starts at 863 and continues through to 883
Here the runaways are described as fallen stars This is also described at the start of
chapter 6 in Genesis - Sons of God (Godlings in Hebrew) desired the daughters of men
These unions gave rise to giants (Nephilim - meaning “to fall”, as in ‘swoop down’)
At 872-3 Enoch describes how beings from heaven, and he actually says they
looked like white men, raised him to their tower 881-3 seems to describe serious
warfare using advanced weapons It is possible that this war and the events surrounding
it are described in the Mahabharata an ancient Hindu text where the gods fight a war
with many advanced weapons, nuclear missiles included, judging from the detailed
descriptions in the text
The story of Noah (possibly 17,000 BC) starts at 891 and continues through to
899 The flood starts at 892 Noah's three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, give rise to
all the animals (nations) at 8910
The white bull at the end of 8910 is Abraham (possibly 2166 - 1991 BC) At
8911 there is Abraham’s son Ishmael (2080 BC) the wild ass, and Isaac (2066 BC) the
white bull
Isaac has a wild boar, Esau, and a white sheep that is Jacob (2006 BC) At the
end of 8912 Jacob has twelve sons – the patriarchs of the 12 tribes
At 8913 Joseph is sold to the Ishmaelites or Midianites (asses) and then (1898
BC) to the Egyptians (wolves), see also Genesis 3725 and 391
Genesis 42 onwards is described at 8914, the time in Egypt At 8915, we get to
events covered in the book of Exodus
There is a long section describing the life of Moses (1526 - 1406 BC), at 8916 –
38; which is probably the reason why Moses believed that Enoch walked with God, (as stated in Genesis 522)
8918 introduces Aaron and the parting of the Red Sea is described by the text at 8924-25
Crossing the river Jordan (1406 BC), 8939, is chapter 3 in the book of Joshua
Also in this verse the Judges get a brief mention
The ram at 8941 is probably Samuel, followed by Saul, 8942, (chapter 22 of Samuel in the bible), and these are followed by David (1010 - 970 BC) at 8945
The dogs are the Philistines
The time of Solomon (970 - 930 BC) is at 8948 and the building of the Temple at 8950 (the tower)
The period after Solomon starts at 8951 with the deaths of prophets The one saved, 8952, is Elijah
At 8956, "he left that house of theirs" probably refers to the time of King
Manasseh when the Levites took the Ark of the Covenant and left Israel (around 670
BC) They also took Enoch's book, and eventually settled in Ethiopia The lions in this
part are the Assyrians
There is a change of scene at 8959, which probably coincides with the religious
reforms under Josiah (620 BC) see chapter 34 of 2Chronicles Then there are the 70
shepherds; these are various religious leaders in Jerusalem since that time
At 8966 there is the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians (587 BC)
The return after the exile (538 BC) is at 8972 The three who return are Ezra,
Haggai, and Zechariah, who all have books in the Bible
The second temple period, is at 8973, this is described in Malachi (450 - 400
BC) his book is the last book of the Old Testament
The eagles first appear in the story at 902 they are the Romans
Fifty-eight of the shepherds have served their time by verse 905
The small lambs with open eyes (906) may be the Essenes
At 908 there is the death of John the Baptist - by the ravens
Jesus is the "sheep with the big horn" at 909-16 Interestingly, it does not say
specifically that he is killed, only that his ministry is stopped by a conspiracy
At 9017, the final twelve shepherds have their own book This must be the
Christian era The prophecy then goes into the future At 9018, God strikes the earth in anger
This is the "second end" in the next section There are no recognizable events after this,
the story goes far off into the future and only time will reveal its meaning

18) PROPHECY OF THE ANIMALS
851 And after this I saw another dream, and I will show it all to you, my son
852 And Enoch raised his voice and said to his son Methuselah: “To you I speak, my son Hear my words, and incline your ear to the dream vision of your father
853 Before I took your mother, Edna, I saw a vision on my bed: - and behold - a bull came out of the earth, and that bull was white And, after it, a heifer came out, and with the heifer came two bullocks, and one of them was black and the other red
854 And that black bullock struck the red one, and pursued it over the earth, and from then on I could not see that red bullock
855 But that black bullock grew, and a heifer went with it; and I saw that many bulls came out from it, which were like it, and followed behind it
856 And that cow, that first one, came from the presence of that first bull, seeking that red bullock, but did not find it And then it moaned bitterly
and continued to seek it
857 And I looked until that first bull came to it, and calmed it, and from that time it did not cry out
858 And after this, she bore another white bull, and after this she bore many black bulls and cows
859 And I saw, in my sleep, that white bull, how it likewise grew and became a large white bull And from it came many white bulls, and they were like it
8510 And they began to beget many white bulls that were like them - one following another
861 And again, I looked with my eyes as I was sleeping, and I saw Heaven above, and behold, a star fell from Heaven, and it arose and ate and pastured amongst those bulls
862 And, after this, I saw the large and the black bulls, and behold, all of them changed their pens, and their pastures, and their heifers And they began to moan, one after another
863 And, again, I saw in the vision and looked up at Heaven, and behold, I saw many stars, how they came down, and were thrown down from Heaven to that first star, and fell amongst those heifers and bulls They were with them pasturing amongst them
864 And I looked at them and saw, and behold, all of them let out their private parts, like horses, and began to mount the cows of the bulls And they all became pregnant and bore elephants, camels, and asses
865 And all the bulls were afraid of them, and were terrified in front of
them And they began to bite with their teeth, and to devour, and to gore
with their horns
866 And so they began to devour those bulls, and behold, all the sons of
the Earth began to tremble and shake before them and to flee
871 And again I saw them, how they began to gore one another, and to
devour one another, and the Earth began to cry out
872 And I raised my eyes again to Heaven, and saw in the vision, and
behold, there came from Heaven beings that were like white men And
four came from that place, and three others with them
873 And those three, who came out last, took hold of me by my hand and
raised me from the generations of the Earth, and lifted me up onto a high
place, and showed me a tower high above the earth, and all the hills were
lower
874 And one said to me: “Remain here until you have seen everything which is coming upon these elephants, and camels, and asses, and upon the stars, and upon all the bulls”
881 And I saw one of those four who had come out first, how he took hold of that first star, which had fallen from Heaven, and bound it by its hands and feet, and threw it into an abyss And that abyss was narrow, and deep, and horrible, and dark
882 And one of them drew his sword, and gave it to those elephants, camels, and asses; and they began to strike one another, and the whole Earth shook because of them
883 And as I looked in the vision, behold, one of those four who had come
out cast a line from Heaven and gathered and took all the large stars; those
whose private parts were like the private parts of horses, and bound them
all by their hands and their feet, and threw them into a chasm of the Earth
891 And one of those four, went to a white bull, and taught him a mystery,
trembling as he was He was born a bull, but became a man, and built for
himself a large vessel, and dwelt on it, and three bulls went with him in that
vessel, and they were covered over
892 And, again, I raised my eyes to Heaven and saw a high roof with
seven water channels on it, and those channels discharged much water into
an enclosure
893 And I looked again, and behold, springs opened on the floor of that
large enclosure, and water began to bubble up, and to rise above the floor
And I looked at that enclosure until its whole floor was covered by water
894 And water, darkness, and mist increased on it, and I looked at the
height of that water, and that water had risen above that enclosure and was
pouring out over the enclosure, and it remained on the earth
895 And all the bulls of that enclosure were gathered together, until I saw
how they sank, and were swallowed up, and destroyed, in that water
896 And that vessel floated on the water, but all the bulls, elephants,
camels, and asses sank to the bottom, together with all the animals, so that I
could not see them And they were unable to get out, but were destroyed,
and sank into the depths
897 And, again, I looked at that vision until those water channels were
removed from that high roof, and the chasms of the Earth were made level,
and other abysses were opened
898 And the water began to run down into them, until the earth became
visible, and that vessel settled on the earth and the darkness departed, and
light appeared
899 And that white bull, who became a man, went out from that vessel,
and the three bulls with him And one of the three bulls was white, like
that bull, and one of them was red as blood, and one was black And that
white bull passed away from them
8910 And they began to beget wild animals and birds, so that there arose
from them every kind of species: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wildboars, foxes, badgers, pigs, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens But
amongst them was born a white bull
8911 And they began to bite one another but that white bull, which was
born amongst them, begat a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the wild
asses increased
8912 But that bull, which was born from it, begat a black wild boar and a
white sheep, and that wild-boar begat many boars and that sheep begat
twelve sheep
8913 And when those twelve sheep had grown, they handed one of their
number over to the asses, and those in turn, handed that sheep over to the
wolves; and that sheep grew up amongst the wolves
8914 And the Lord brought the eleven sheep to dwell with it, and to
pasture with it amongst the wolves, and they increased and became many
flocks of sheep
8915 And the wolves began to make them afraid, and they oppressed them
until they made away with their young, and then they threw their young
into a river with much water; but those sheep began to cry out because of
their young, and to complain to their Lord
8916 But a sheep, which had been saved from the wolves, fled and escaped
to the wild asses And I saw the sheep moaning and crying out, and
petitioning the Lord with all their power, until that Lord of the sheep came
down at the call of the sheep, from a high room, and came to them, and
looked at them
8917 And he called that sheep, which had fled from the wolves, and spoke
to it about the wolves, that it should warn them that they should not touch
the sheep
8918 And the sheep went to the wolves, in accordance with the Word of
the Lord, and another sheep met that sheep and went with it And the two
of them together, entered the assembly of those wolves, spoke to them, and
warned them that from then on, they should not touch those sheep
8919 And after this, I saw the wolves, how they acted even more harshly
towards the sheep, with all their power, and the sheep called out
8920 And their Lord came to the sheep and began to beat those wolves;
and the wolves began to moan, but the sheep became silent and from then
on they did not cry out
8921 And I looked at the sheep until they escaped from the wolves; but the
eyes of the wolves were blinded, and those wolves went out in pursuit of
the sheep with all their forces
8922 And the Lord of the sheep went with them, as he led them, and all his
sheep followed him; and his face was glorious, and his appearance terrible
and magnificent
8923 But the wolves began to pursue those sheep until they met them by a
stretch of water
8924 And that stretch of water was divided, and the water stood on one
side, and on the other, before them And their Lord as he led them, stood
between them and the wolves
8925 And while those wolves had not yet seen the sheep, they went into
the middle of that stretch of water; but the wolves pursued the sheep, and
those wolves ran after them into that stretch of water
8926 But when they saw the Lord of the sheep they turned to flee in front
of him; but that stretch of water flowed together again, and suddenly
resumed its natural form, and the water swelled up, and rose until it
covered those wolves
8927 And I looked until all the wolves that had pursued those sheep were
destroyed and drowned
8928 But the sheep escaped that water, and went to a desert, where there
was neither water, nor grass And they began to open their eyes and see,
and I saw the Lord of the sheep pasturing them, and giving them water and
grass, and that sheep going and leading them
8929 And that sheep went up to the summit of a high rock and the Lord of
the sheep sent it to them
8930 And after this, I saw the Lord of the sheep standing before them, and
his appearance was terrible and majestic, and all those sheep saw him and
were afraid of him
8931 And all of them were afraid and trembled before him; and they cried
out to that sheep, with those who were in their midst: “We cannot stand
before our Lord nor look at him”
8932 And that sheep, which led them, again went up to the summit of that
rock; and the sheep began to be blinded, and go astray from the path which
had been shown to them, but that sheep did not know
8933 And the Lord of the sheep was extremely angry with them, and that
sheep knew, and went down from the summit of the rock, and came to the
sheep, and found the majority of them, with their eyes blinded, and going
astray from his path
8934 And when they saw it they were afraid and trembled before it and
wished that they could return to their enclosure And that sheep took some
other sheep with it, and went to those sheep that had gone astray, and then
began to kill them; and the sheep were afraid of it And that sheep brought
back those sheep that had gone astray, and they returned to their enclosures
8936 And I looked there at the vision, until that sheep became a man, and
built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and made all the sheep stand in that
house
8937 And I looked until that sheep, which had met that sheep that led the
sheep, fell asleep And I looked until all the large sheep were destroyed
and small ones arose in their place, and they came to a pasture, and drew
near a river of water
8938 And that sheep that led them, which had become a man, separated
from them and fell asleep, and all the sheep sought it, and cried out very
bitterly over it
8939 And I looked until they left off crying for that sheep, and crossed that
river of water And there arose all the sheep that led them, in place of those
which had fallen asleep; and they led
8940 And I looked until the sheep came to a good place and a pleasant and
glorious land, and I looked until those sheep were satisfied And that house
was in the middle of them in that green and pleasant land
8941 And sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes blinded, until
another sheep rose up, led them, and brought them all back And their eyes
were opened
8942 And the dogs, and the foxes, and the wild boars, began to devour
those sheep until the Lord of the sheep raised up a ram from among them,
which led them
8943 And that ram began to butt those dogs, foxes, and wild boars, on one
side and on the other until it had destroyed them all
8944 And the eyes of that sheep were opened, and it saw that ram in the
middle of the sheep, how it renounced its glory, and began to butt those
sheep, and how it trampled on them and behaved unbecomingly
8945 And the Lord of the sheep sent the sheep to another sheep and raised
it up to be a ram and to lead the sheep in place of that sheep which had
renounced its glory
8946 And it went to it, and spoke with it alone, and raised up that ram, and
made it the prince and leader of the sheep And, during all this, those dogs
oppressed the sheep
8947 And the first ram pursued that second ram and that second ram rose
and fled before it And I looked until those dogs made the first ram fall
8948 And that second ram rose up and led the small sheep, and that ram
begat many sheep, and fell asleep And a small sheep became a ram, in
place of it, and became the prince and leader of those sheep
8949 And those sheep grew and increased; but all the dogs, and foxes, and
wild boars, were afraid and fled from it And that ram butted and killed all
the animals, and those animals did not again prevail amongst the sheep, and
did not seize anything further from them
8950 And that house became large and broad, and for those sheep a high
tower was built on that house for the Lord of the sheep And that house
was low but the tower was raised up and high And the Lord of the sheep
stood on that tower and they spread a full table before him
8951 And I saw those sheep again, how they went astray, and walked in
many ways, and left that house of theirs; and the Lord of the sheep called
some of the sheep, and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to kill
them
8952 But one of them was saved, and was not killed, and it sprang away
and cried out against the sheep And they wished to kill it but the Lord of
the sheep saved it from the hands of the sheep, brought it up to me, and
made it stay
8953 And he sent many other sheep to those sheep, to testify to them and
to lament over them
8954 And after this, I saw how when they left the house of the Lord of the
sheep, and his tower, they went astray in everything, and their eyes were
blinded And I saw how the Lord of the sheep wrought much slaughter
among them, in their pastures, until those sheep invited that slaughter, and
betrayed his place
8955 And he gave them into the hands of the lions, and the tigers, and the
wolves, and the hyenas, and into the hands of the foxes, and to all the
animals And those wild animals began to tear those sheep in pieces
8956 And I saw how he left that house of theirs, and their tower, and gave
them all into the hands of the lions so that they might tear them in pieces
and devour them, and into the hands of all the animals
8957 And I began to cry out with all my power, to call the Lord of the
sheep, and to represent to him concerning the sheep; that all the wild
animals were devouring them
8958 But he remained still, although he saw, and he rejoiced that they were
devoured, swallowed up and carried off And he gave them into the hands
of all the animals for food
8959 And he called seventy shepherds, and cast off those sheep, so that
they might pasture them And he said to the shepherds and to their
companions: “Each one of you, from now on, is to pasture the sheep and
do whatever I command you
8960 And I will hand them over to you, duly numbered, and I will tell you
which of them are to be destroyed, and destroy them” And he handed
those sheep over to them
8961 And he called another, and said to him: “Observe and see everything
that these shepherds do against these sheep for they will destroy from
among them more than I have commanded them
8962 And write down all the excess and destruction, which is wrought by
the shepherds; how many they destroy at my command and how many they
destroy of their own volition Write down against each shepherd,
individually, all that he destroys
8963 And read out in front of me exactly how many they destroy of their
own volition and how many are handed over for destruction so that this
may be a testimony for me against them So that I may know all the deeds
of the shepherds in order to hand them over for judgment And I will see
what they do, whether they abide by my command with which I have
commanded them, or not
8964 But they must not know this, and you must not show this to them, but
only write down against each individual in his time all that the shepherds
destroy, and bring it all up to me”
8965 And I looked until those shepherds pastured at their times, and they
began to kill and destroy more than they were commanded, and they gave
those sheep into the hands of the lions
8966 And the lions and the tigers devoured and swallowed up the majority
of those sheep, and the wild boars devoured with them; and they burnt
down that tower and demolished that house
8967 And I was extremely sad about that tower because that house of the
sheep had been demolished; and after that I was unable to see whether
those sheep went into that house
8968 And the shepherds and their companions handed those sheep over to
all the animals so that they might devour them Each one of them, at his
time, received an exact number, and for each of them, one after the other,
there was written in a book how many of them were destroyed
8969 And each one killed and destroyed more than was prescribed and I
began to weep and moan very much because of those sheep
8970 And likewise, in the vision, I saw that one who wrote, how each day,
he wrote down each one that was destroyed by those shepherds And he
brought up, and presented, the whole book to the Lord of the sheep,
everything they had done and all that each one of them had made away
with, and all that they had handed to destruction
8971 And the book was read out in front of the Lord of the sheep, and he
took the book in his hand, read it, sealed it, and put it down
8972 And after this I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours,
and behold three of those sheep returned, and arrived, and came and began
to build up all that had fallen down from that house; but the wild boars
hindered them so that they could not
8973 And they again began to build, as before, and they raised up that
tower, and it was called the high tower And they began again to place a
table before the tower but all the bread on it was unclean and was not pure
8974 And, besides all this, the eyes of these sheep were blinded so that
they could not see, and their shepherds likewise And they handed yet
more of them over to destruction, and they trampled on the sheep with their
feet, and devoured them
8975 But the Lord of the sheep remained still, until all the sheep were
scattered abroad, and had mixed with them, and they did not save them
from the hands of the animals
8976 And that one who wrote the book brought it up, showed it, and read
it out in the dwelling of the Lord of the sheep And he entreated Him on
behalf of them, and petitioned Him, as he showed Him all the deeds of their
shepherds and testified in front of Him against all the shepherds
8977 And he took the book, put it down by Him, and went out
901 And I looked until the time that thirty-five shepherds had pastured the
sheep the same way, and, each individually; they all completed their time
like the first ones And others received them into their hands to pasture
them, at their time, each shepherd at his own time
902 And after this, I saw in the vision, all the birds of the sky coming: The eagles, the vultures, and the kites, and the ravens But the eagles led
all the birds, and they began to devour those sheep, to peck out their eyes,
and to devour their flesh
903 And the sheep cried out because the birds devoured their flesh And I
cried out and lamented in my sleep because of that shepherd who pastured
the sheep
904 And I looked until those sheep were devoured by those dogs, and by
the eagles, and by the kites, and they left them neither flesh nor skin, nor
sinew, until only their bones remained And their bones fell upon the
ground and the sheep became few
905 And I looked until the time that twenty-three shepherds had pastured,
and they completed, each in his time, fifty eight times
906 And small lambs were born from those white sheep, and they began to
open their eyes, to see, and to cry to the sheep
907 But the sheep did not cry to them, and did not listen to what they said
to them, but were extremely deaf, and their eyes were extremely and
excessively blinded
908 And I saw in the vision, how the ravens flew upon those lambs, and
took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured
them
909 And I looked until horns came up on those lambs but the ravens cast
their horns down And I looked until a big horn grew on one of those
sheep, and their eyes were opened
9010 And it looked at them and their eyes were opened And it cried to the
sheep, and the rams saw it, and they all ran to it
9011 And, besides all this, those eagles, and vultures, and ravens, and
kites, were still continually tearing the sheep in pieces, and flying upon
them and devouring them And the sheep were silent but the rams lamented and cried out
9012 And those ravens battled and fought with it, and wished to make
away with its horn, but they did not prevail against it
9013 And I looked at them until the shepherds and the eagles, and those
vultures, and kites, came and cried to the ravens that they should dash the
horn of that ram in pieces And they fought and battled with it, and it
fought with them and cried out so that its help might come to it
9014 And I looked until that man, who wrote down the names of the
shepherds and brought them up before the Lord of the sheep, came, and he
helped that ram and showed it everything; its help was coming down
9015 And I looked until that Lord of the sheep came to them in anger, all
those who saw him fled, and they all fell into the shadow in front of Him
9016 All the eagles and vultures and ravens and kites, gathered together
and brought with them all the wild sheep, and they all came together and
helped one another in order to dash that horn of the ram in pieces
9017 And I looked at that man, who wrote the book at the command of the
Lord, until he opened that book of the destruction that those last twelve
shepherds had wrought And he showed, in front of the Lord of the sheep,
that they had destroyed even more than those before them had
9018 And I looked until the Lord of the sheep came to them and took the
Staff of His Anger and struck the Earth And the Earth was split And all
the animals, and the birds of the sky, fell from those sheep and sank in the
earth; and it closed over them
9019 And I looked until a big sword was given to the sheep And the
sheep went out against all the wild animals to kill them And all the
animals, and birds of the sky, fled before them
9020 And I looked until a throne was set up in a pleasant land and the Lord
of the sheep sat on it And they took all the sealed books and opened the
books in front of the Lord of the sheep
9021 And the Lord called those men, the seven first white ones, and
commanded them to bring in front of Him the first star, which went before
those stars whose private parts were like horses, and they brought them all
in front of Him
9022 And He said to that man who wrote in front of Him, who was one of
the seven white ones, He said to him: “Take those seventy shepherds, to
whom I handed over the sheep, and who, on their own authority, took and
killed more than I commanded them”
9023 And behold, I saw them all bound, and they all stood in front of Him
9024 And the judgment was held, first on the stars, and they were judged
and found guilty, and they went to the place of damnation, and were thrown
into a deep place full of fire burning, and full of pillars of fire
9025 And those seventy shepherds were judged, and found guilty, and they
also were thrown into that abyss of fire
9026 And I saw at that time, how a similar abyss was opened in the middle
of the Earth which was full of fire, and they brought those blind sheep and
they were all judged, and found guilty, and thrown into that abyss of fire
and they burned And that abyss was on the south of that house
9027 And I saw those sheep burning and their bones were burning
9028 And I stood up to look until he folded up that old house, and they
removed all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of that house were
folded up with it And they removed it and put it in a place in the south of
the land
9029 And I looked until the Lord of the sheep brought a new house, larger
and higher than the first one, and he set it up on the site of the first one that
had been folded up And all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were
new and larger than those of the first one - the old one that had been
removed And the Lord of the sheep was in the middle of it
9030 And I saw all the sheep that were left, and all the animals of the
earth, and all the birds of the sky, falling down and worshipping those
sheep, and entreating them and obeying them in every command
9031 And after this, those three who were dressed in white and had taken
hold of my hand, the ones who had brought me up at first They, with the
hand of that ram also holding me, took me up, and put me down in the
middle of those sheep before the judgment was held
9032 And those sheep were all white and their wool thick and pure
9033 And all those which had been destroyed and scattered, and all the
wild animals, and all the birds of the sky, gathered together in that house,
and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced very much because they were all good,
and had returned to His house
9034 And I looked until they had laid down that sword, which had been
given to the sheep, and they brought it back into his house, and it was
sealed in front of the Lord And all the sheep were enclosed in that house
but it did not hold them
9035 And the eyes of all of them were opened, and they saw well, and
there was not one among them that did not see
9036 And I saw that that house was large, broad, and exceptionally full
9037 And I saw how a white bull was born, and its horns were big, and all
the wild animals, and all the birds of the sky, were afraid of it, and
entreated it continually
9038 And I looked until all their species were transformed and they all
became white bulls And the first among them was a wild-ox And that
wild-ox was a large animal and had big black horns on its head And the
Lord of the sheep rejoiced over them, and over all the bulls
9039 And I was asleep in the middle of them and I woke up and saw
everything
9040 And this is the vision which I saw while I was asleep, and I woke up,
blessed the Lord of Righteousness, and ascribed glory to him
9041 But after this I wept bitterly and my tears did not stop until I could
not endure it When I looked, they ran down, because of what I saw, for
everything will come to pass and be fulfilled, and all the deeds of men, in
their order, were shown to me
9042 That night I remembered my first dream, and because of it I wept,
and was disturbed, because I had seen that vision

19) PROPHECY OF THE TEN WEEKS

911 And now my son Methuselah, call to me all your brothers, and gather
to me all the children of your mother For a voice calls me, and a spirit has
been poured over me, so that I may show you everything that will come
upon you forever

912 And after this Methuselah went and called his brothers to him and
gathered his relations

913 And he spoke about righteousness to all his sons, and said:
“Hear, my children, all the words of your father, and listen properly to the
voice of my mouth, for I will testify and speak to you - my beloved Love
uprightness and walk in it!
914 And do not draw near to uprightness with a double heart, and do not
associate with those of a double heart, but walk in righteousness my
children and it will lead you in good paths, and righteousness will be your
companion
915 For I know that the state of wrongdoing will continue on Earth, and a
great punishment will be carried out on the Earth, and an end will be made
of all iniquity And it will be cut off at its roots and its whole edifice will
pass away
916 And iniquity will again be complete on the Earth, and all the deeds of
iniquity, and the deeds of wrong, and of wickedness, will prevail for a
second time”
921 Written by Enoch-the-Scribe, this complete wisdom and teaching,
praised by all men and a judge of the whole Earth
For all my sons who dwell on Earth And for the last generations who will
practice justice and peace
922 Let not your spirit be saddened by the times for the Holy and Great
One has appointed days for all things
923 And the righteous man will rise from sleep, will rise and will walk in
the path of righteousness, and all his paths, and his journeys, will be in
eternal goodness and mercy
924 He will show mercy to the righteous man and to him give eternal
uprightness, and to him give power And he will live in goodness, and
righteousness, and will walk in eternal light
925 And sin will be destroyed in darkness, forever, and from that day will
never again be seen
931 And, after this, Enoch began to speak from the books:
932 And Enoch said: “Concerning the sons of righteousness, and
concerning the chosen of the world, and concerning the plant of
righteousness and uprightness, I will speak these things to you, and make
them known to you, my children
I, Enoch, according to that which appeared to me in the Heavenly vision,
and that which I know from the words of the Holy Angels, and
understanding from the Tablets of Heaven”
933 And Enoch then began to speak from the books, and said: “I was born
the seventh, in the first week, while justice and righteousness still lasted
934 And, after me, in the second week, great injustice will arise, and
deceit will have sprung up And in it there will be the First End, and in it, a
man will be saved And after it has ended, iniquity will grow, and He will
make a law for the sinners
935 And after this in the third week, at its end, a man will be chosen as
the Plant of Righteous Judgment, and after him will come the Plant of
Righteousness, forever
936 And after this, in the fourth week, at its end, visions of the righteous and Holy will be seen, and a Law for All Generations, and an enclosure will be made for them
937 And after this, in the fifth week, at its end, a House of Glory and
Sovereignty will be built forever
938 And after this, in the sixth week, all those who live in it will be
blinded And the hearts of them all, lacking wisdom, will sink into impiety
And in it, a man will ascend, and at its end the House of Sovereignty will
be burnt with fire And in it the whole race of the chosen root will be
scattered
939 And after this, in the seventh week, an apostate generation will arise
And many will be its deeds - but all its deeds will be apostasy
9310 And at its end, the Chosen Righteous, from the Eternal Plant of
Righteousness, will be chosen, to whom will be given sevenfold teaching,
concerning his whole creation
917 And when iniquity, and sin, and blasphemy, and wrong, and all kinds
of evil deeds increase, and when apostasy, wickedness, and uncleanness
increase, a great punishment will come from Heaven upon all these And
the Holy Lord will come in anger, and in wrath, to execute judgment on the
Earth
918 In those days wrongdoing will be cut off at its roots, and the roots of
iniquity, together with deceit, will be destroyed from under Heaven
919 And all the idols of the nations will be given up, their towers will be
burnt in fire, and they will remove them from the whole Earth And they
will be thrown down into the Judgment of Fire, and will be destroyed in
anger, and in the severe judgment that is forever
9110 And the righteous will rise from sleep, and wisdom will rise, and will
be given to them
9111 And after this the roots of iniquity will be cut off and the sword will
destroy the sinners The blasphemers will be cut off; in every place
blasphemy will be destroyed by the sword
9112 And after this there will be another week; the eighth, that of
righteousness, and a sword will be given to it so that the Righteous
Judgment may be executed on those who do wrong, and the sinners will be
handed over into the hands of the righteous
9113 And, at its end, they will acquire Houses because of their
righteousness, and a House will be built for the Great King in Glory,
forever
9114 And after this, in the ninth week, the Righteous Judgment will be
revealed to the whole world And all the deeds of the impious will vanish
from the whole Earth And the world will be written down for destruction
and all men will look to the Path of Uprightness
9115 And, after this, in the tenth week, in the seventh part, there will be
an Eternal Judgment that will be executed on the Watchers and the Great
Eternal Heaven that will spring from the midst of the Angels
9116 And the First Heaven will vanish and pass away and a New Heaven
will appear, and all the Powers of Heaven will shine forever, with
sevenfold light
9117 And after this, there will be many weeks without number, forever, in
goodness and in righteousness And from then on sin will never again be
mentioned
9118 And now I tell you, my children, and show you the paths of
righteousness, and the paths of wrongdoing And I will show you again so
that you may know what is to come
9119 And now listen, my children, walk in the paths of righteousness and
do not walk in the paths of wrongdoing, for all those who walk in the path
of iniquity will be destroyed forever
9311 For is there any man who can hear the voice of the Holy One and not be disturbed? And who is there who can think his thoughts? And who is there who can look at all the works of Heaven?
9312 And how should there be anyone who could understand the works of Heaven, and see a soul, or a spirit, and tell about it, or ascend and see all their ends and comprehend them, or make anything like them?
9313 And is there any man who could know the length and breadth of the
Earth? And to who has all its measurements been shown?
9314 Or is there any man who could know the length of Heaven, and what
is its height, and on what is it fixed, and how large is the number of stars,
and where do all the lights rest?
Notes Start: (20) ENOCH'S MESSAGE OF GUIDANCE (pages 143-155)

This is spiritual guidance from Enoch based on the teachings of the Watchers
The message is directed towards his family, and towards later generations, and concerns
the importance of avoiding sin during your lifetime
The message is also directed towards strengthening the spirits of people
suffering hard times, and Enoch stresses that God will deal with everyone justly, at the
appointed time
Near to the end of this section (10411) Enoch encourages people such as me,
who will come later and copy his book into other languages, to do it carefully and
exactly – which I have tried my best to do

20) ENOCH'S MESSAGE OF GUIDANCE
941 And now I say to you, my children, love righteousness and walk in it;
for the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptance, but the paths of
iniquity will quickly be destroyed and vanish
942 And to certain men, from a future generation, the paths of wrongdoing
and of death will be revealed; and they will keep away from them and will
not follow them
943 And now I say to you, the righteous: do not walk in the wicked path,
or in wrongdoing, or in the paths of death, and do not draw near to them or
you may be destroyed
944 But seek, and choose for yourself, righteousness, and a life that is
pleasing and walk in the paths of peace so that you may live and prosper
945 And hold my words firmly in the thoughts of your heart, and do not let
them be erased from your heart, for I know that sinners will tempt men to
debase wisdom, and no place will be found for it, and temptation will in no
way decrease
946 Woe to those who build iniquity and found deceit for they will quickly
be thrown down and will not have peace
947 Woe to those who build their houses with sin, for from their whole
foundation they will be thrown down, and by the sword they shall fall, and
those who acquire gold and silver will quickly be destroyed in the
judgment
948 Woe to you, you rich, for you have trusted in your riches, but from
your riches you will depart for you did not remember the Most High in the
days of your riches
949 You have committed blasphemy, and iniquity, and are ready for the
days of the outpouring of blood, and for the day of darkness, and for the
day of the Great Judgment
9410 Thus I say, and make known to you, that He who created you will
throw you down, and over your fall there will be no mercy, but your creator
will rejoice at your destruction
9411 And your righteousness in those days will be a reproach to the
sinners and to the impious
951 Would that my eyes were a rain-cloud, so that I might weep over you,
and pour out my tears like rain, so that I might have rest from the sorrow of
my heart!
952 Who permitted you to practice hatred and wickedness? May judgment
come upon you, the sinners!
953 Do not be afraid of the sinners, you righteous, for the Lord will again
deliver them into your hands, so that you may execute judgment on them as
you desire
954 Woe to you who pronounce anathema that you cannot remove
Healing will be far from you because of your sin
955 Woe to you who repay your neighbours with evil for you will be
repaid according to your deeds
956 Woe to you, you lying witnesses, and to those who weigh out iniquity,
for you will quickly be destroyed
957 Woe to you, you sinners, because you persecute the righteous, for you
yourselves will be handed over and persecuted, you men of iniquity, and
their yoke will be heavy on you
961 Be hopeful, you righteous, for the sinners will quickly be destroyed
before you, and you will have power over them, as you desire
962 And in the day of the distress of the sinners, your young will rise up,
like eagles, and your nest will be higher than that of vultures And you will
go up, and like badgers, enter the crevices of the earth, and the clefts of the
rock, forever, before the lawless, but they will groan and weep because of
you, like satyrs
963 And do not be afraid you who have suffered, for you will receive
healing, and a bright light will shine upon you, and the Voice of Rest you
will hear from Heaven
964 Woes to you, you sinners, for your riches make you appear righteous,
but your hearts prove you to be sinners And this word will be a testimony
against you as a reminder of your evil deeds
965 Woe to you who devour the finest of the wheat, and drink the best of
the water, and trample upon the humble through your power
966 Woe to you who drink water all the time, for you will quickly be
repaid, and will become exhausted and dry for you have left the spring of
life
967 Woe to you who commit iniquity, and deceit, and blasphemy, it will
be a reminder of evil against you
968 Woe to you, you powerful, who through power oppress the righteous;
for the day of your destruction will come
In those days many good days will come for the righteous in the day of
your judgment
971 Believe, you righteous, that the sinners will become an object of
shame and will be destroyed on the Day of Judgment
972 Be it known to you, sinners, that the Most High remembers your
destruction and that the Angels rejoice over your destruction
973 What will you do, you sinners, and where will you flee on that day of
judgment when you hear the sound of prayer of the righteous?
974 But you will not be like them against whom this word will be a
testimony:
“You have been associated with the sinners”
975 And in those days, the prayer of the Holy will be in front of the Lord,
and for you will come the days of your judgment
976 And the words of your iniquity will be read out before the Great and
Holy One, and your faces will blush with shame, and every deed which is
founded upon iniquity will be rejected
977 Woe to you, you sinners, who are in the middle of the sea, or on dry
ground, their memory will be harmful to you
978 Woe to you who acquire silver and gold, but not in righteousness, and
say: “We have become very rich and have possessions, and have acquired
everything that we desired
979 And now let us do what we planned, for we have gathered silver and
filled our storehouses, and as many as water are the servants of our
houses”
9710 And like the water your life will flow away, for your riches will not
stay with you, but will quickly go up from you, for you acquired everything
in iniquity and you will be given over to a great curse
981 Now I swear to you, the wise, and the foolish, that you will see many
things on the earth
982 For you men will put on yourselves more adornments than a woman,
and more coloured garments than a girl, clothed in sovereignty, and in
majesty, and in power, and silver, and gold, and purple, and honours, - and
food will be poured out like water
983 Because of this they will have neither knowledge nor wisdom And
through this, they will be destroyed, together with their possessions, and
with all their glory and their honour And in shame, and in slaughter, and
in great destitution, their spirits will be thrown into the fiery furnace
984 I swear to you, you sinners, that as a mountain has not, and will not,
become a slave, nor a hill a woman's maid, so sin was not sent on the Earth
but man, of himself, created it And those who commit it will be subject to
a great curse
985 And barrenness has not been given to a woman but because of the deeds of her hand she dies without children
986 I swear to you, you sinners, by the Holy and Great One, that all your
evil deeds are revealed in Heaven and that your wrongdoing is not covered or hidden
987 And do not think in your spirit nor say in your heart, that you do not know, or do not see, every sin is written down every day in Heaven in front of the Most High
988 From now on, you know that all your wrongdoing that you do will be written down every day, until the day of your judgment
989 Woe to you, you fools, for you will be destroyed through your folly
And you do not listen to the wise and good will not come upon you
9810 And now know that you are ready for the day of destruction And do
not hope that you will live, you sinners; rather you will go and die, for you
know no ransom You are ready for the Day of the Great Judgment and for
the day of distress and great shame for your spirits
9811 Woe to you, you stubborn of heart who do evil and eat blood, from
where do you have good things to eat and drink and to be satisfied? From
all the good things which our Lord the Most High has placed in abundance
on the earth Therefore you will not have peace
9812 Woe to you who love deeds of iniquity Why do you hope for good
for yourselves? Know that you will be given into the hands of the
righteous, and they will cut your throats and kill you, and will not have
mercy on you
9813 Woe to you who rejoice in the distress of the righteous for graves
will not be dug for you
9814 Woe to you who declare the words of the righteous empty for you
will have no hope of life
9815 Woe to you who write lying words, and the words of the impious, for
they write their lies so that men may hear and continue their folly And
they will not have peace but will die a sudden death
991 Woe to you who do impious deeds and praise and honour lying words;
you will be destroyed and will not have a good life
992 Woe to you who alter the words of truth, and they distort the eternal
law and count themselves as being without sin; they will be trampled
underfoot on the ground
993 In those days make ready, you righteous, to raise your prayers as a
reminder and lay them as a testimony before the Angels, that they may lay
the sin of the sinners before the Most High as a reminder
994 In those days the nations will be thrown into confusion and the races
of the nations will rise on the Day of Destruction
995 And in those days, those who are in need will go out, seize their
children, and cast out their children And their offspring will slip from
them, and they will cast out their children while they are still sucklings, and
will not return to them, and will not have mercy on their beloved ones
996 And again I swear to you, the sinners, that sin is ready for the Day of
Unceasing Bloodshed
997 And they worship stone, and some carve images of gold and of silver,
and of wood and of clay And some, with no knowledge, worship unclean
spirits and demons, and every kind of error But no help will be obtained
from them
998 And they will sink into impiety because of the folly of their hearts,
and their eyes will be blinded through the fear of their hearts, and through
the vision of their ambitions
999 Through these they will become impious and fearful, for they do all
their deeds with lies, and worship stones, and they will be destroyed at the
same moment
9910 And in those days, blessed are those who accept the words of wisdom, and understand them, and follow the paths of the Most High, and walk in the path of righteousness, and do not act impiously with the impious, for they will be saved 
9911 Woe to you who extend evil to your neighbours; for you will be killed in Sheol
9912 Woe to you who lay foundations of sin and deceit, and who cause bitterness on the Earth, for because of this an end will be made of them
9913 Woe to you who build your houses with the toil of others, and all their building materials are the sticks and stones of sin; I say to you: “You will not have peace”
9914 Woe to those who reject the measure, and the eternal inheritance of
their fathers, and cause their souls to follow error, for they will not have
rest
9915 Woe to those who commit iniquity, and help wrong, and kill their
neighbours, until the Day of the Great Judgment; for he will throw down
your glory
9916 And you put evil into your hearts, and rouse the spirit of his anger, so
that he may destroy you all with the sword And all the righteous and the
Holy will remember your sin
1001 And in those days, and in one place, fathers and sons will strike one
another, and brothers will together fall in death, until their blood flows as if
it were a stream
1002 For a man will not, in mercy, withhold his hand from his sons, nor
from his son's sons, in order to kill them And the sinner will not withhold
his hand from his honoured brother from dawn until the Sun sets they will
kill one another
1003 And the horse will walk up to its chest in the blood of sinners and the
chariot will sink up to its height
1004 And in those days the Angels will come down into the hidden places,
and gather together in one place all those who have helped sin, and the
Most High will rise on that day to execute the Great Judgment on all the sinners
1005 And he will set guards, from the Holy Angels, over all the righteous
and Holy, and they will guard them like the apple of an eye, until an end is
made of all evil and all sin And even if the righteous sleep a long sleep
they have nothing to fear
1006 And the wise men will see the truth, and the sons of the Earth will
understand all the words of this book, and they will know that their riches
will not be able to save them or overthrow their sin
1007 Woe to you, you sinners, when you afflict the righteous on the day of
severe trouble, and burn them with fire, you will be repaid according to
your deeds
1008 Woe to you, you perverse of heart who watch to devise evil; fear will
come upon you and there is no one who will help you
1009 Woe to you, you sinners, for an account of the words of your mouth,
and for an account of the deeds of your hands that you have impiously
done; you will burn in blazing flames of fire
10010 And now know that the Angels will inquire in Heaven into your
deeds, from the Sun and the Moon and the Stars, into your sins, for on earth
you execute judgment on the righteous
10011 And all the clouds and mist and dew and rain will testify against
you, for they will be withheld from you so that they do not fall on you, and
they will think about your sins
10012 And now give gifts to the rain, so that it may not be withheld from
falling on you, and so that the dew, if it has accepted gold and silver from
you, may fall
10013 When the hoarfrost and snow, with their cold, and all the snowwinds with their torments fall on you In those days, you will not be able to
stand before them
1011 Contemplate Heaven, all you sons of Heaven, and all the works of the Most High, and fear him, and do not do evil in front of Him
1012 If He closes the Windows of Heaven, and withholds the rain and the
dew, so that it does not fall on the earth because of you, what will you do?
1013 And if he sends his anger upon you, and upon all your deeds, will
you not entreat him? For you speak proud and hard against his
righteousness And you will not have peace
1014 And do you not see the captains of the ships; how their ships are
tossed by the waves and rocked by the winds and are in distress?
1015 And because of this they are afraid, for all their good possessions that
go out on the sea with them, and they think nothing good in their hearts,
only that the sea will swallow them up, and that they will be destroyed in it
1016 Is not all the sea, and all its waters, and all its movement, the work of
the Most High, and did he not seal all it’s doings and bind it all with sand?
1017 And at his rebuke it dries up and becomes afraid, and all its fish die,
and everything in it; but you sinners who are on Earth do not fear him
1018 Did he not make Heaven, Earth, and everything that is in them? And
who gave knowledge, and wisdom, to all things that move on the ground
and in the sea?
1019 And do not those captains of the ships fear the sea?
Yet, sinners do not fear the Most High
1021 And in those days, if he brings a fierce fire upon you, where will you
flee, and where will you be safe? And when he utters his voice against you
will you not be terrified and afraid?
1022 And all the Lights will shake with great fear, and the whole Earth
will be terrified, and will tremble and quail
1023 And all the Angels will carry out their commands, and will seek to
hide from the One who is Great in Glory, and the children of the Earth will
tremble and shake; and you sinners will be cursed forever and will not have
peace
151



1024 Do not be afraid you souls of the righteous, and be hopeful, you who
have died in righteousness
1025 And do not be sad that your souls have gone down into Sheol in
sadness and that your bodies did not obtain during your life a reward in
accordance with your goodness
1026 But when you die the sinners will say about you: “As we die, the
righteous have also died, and of what use to them were their deeds?”
1027 “Behold, like us they have died in sadness and in darkness, and what
advantage do they have over us? From now on we are equal”
1028 “And what will they receive and what will they see forever? For
behold, they too have died, and from now on they will never again see the
light”
1029 And I say to you, you sinners: “You are content to eat and drink, and
strip men naked, and steal, and sin, and acquire possessions, and see good
days
10210 But you saw the righteous, how their end was peace, for no wrong
was found in them until the day of their death”
10211 “But they were destroyed and became as though they had not been
and their souls went down to Sheol in distress”
1031 And now I swear to you, the righteous, by His Great Glory and His
Honour, and by His Magnificent Sovereignty, and by His Majesty: - I
swear to you that I understand this mystery
1032 And I have read the Tablets of Heaven and seen the writing of the
Holy Ones And I found written and engraved in it, concerning them, that
all good, and joy, and honour, have been made ready, and written down, for
the spirits of those who died in righteousness
1033 And much good will be given to you in recompense for your toil and
that your lot will be more excellent than the lot of the living
1034 And the spirits of you who have died in righteousness will live, and
152



your spirits will rejoice and be glad, and the memory of them will remain in
front of the Great One for all the generations of eternity Therefore do not
fear their abuse
1035 Woe to you, you sinners, when you die in your sin, and those who
are like you say about you: “Blessed were the sinners they saw their days
1036 And now they have died in prosperity and wealth, distress and
slaughter they did not see during their life, but they have died in glory, and
judgment was not executed on them in their life”
1037 Know that their souls will be made to go down into Sheol, they will
be wretched, and their distress will be great
1038 And in darkness, and in chains, and in burning flames, your spirits
will come to the Great Judgment And the Great Judgment will last for all
generations, forever Woe to you for you will not have peace
1039 Do not say, the righteous and the good who were alive; “In the days
of our affliction we toiled laboriously, and saw every affliction, and met
many evils We were spent and became few and our spirit small
10310 We were destroyed and there was no one who helped us with words
or with deeds We were powerless and found nothing We were tortured
and destroyed and did not expect to see life from one day to the next
103 11 We hoped to become the head but became the tail We toiled and
laboured, but were not masters of the fruits of our toil; we became food for
the sinners, and the lawless made their yoke heavy upon us
10312 Those who hated us, those who goaded us, were masters of us And
to those who hated us we bowed our necks but they did not have mercy on
us
10313 We sought to escape from them so that we might flee and be at rest
But we found no place where we might flee and be safe from them
10314 We complained about them to the rulers, in our distress, and cried
out against those who devoured us, but they took no notice of our cries, and
153



did not wish to listen to our voice
10315 And they helped those who plundered us and devoured us, and
those who made us few, and they concealed their wrongdoing, and did not
remove from us the yoke of those who devoured us, and scattered us, and
killed us And they concealed our slaughter and did not remember that they
had raised their hands against us”
1041 I swear to you, you righteous, that in Heaven the Angels remember
you for good in front of the Glory of the Great One, and that your names
are written down in front of the Glory of the Great One
1042 Be hopeful! For you were formerly put to shame through evils and
afflictions, but now you will shine like the Lights of Heaven, and will be
seen, and the Gate of Heaven will be opened to you
1043 And persevere in your cry for judgment and it will appear to you, for
justice will be exacted from the rulers for all your distress, and from all
those who helped those who plundered you
1044 Be hopeful, and do not abandon your hope, for you will have great
joy like the Angels of Heaven
1045 What will you have to do? You will not have to hide on the day of
the Great Judgment, nor will you be found to be sinners The Eternal
Judgment will be upon you for all the generations of eternity
1046 And now do not be afraid, you righteous, when you see the sinners
growing strong and prospering in their desires, and do not be associated
with them but keep far away from their wrongdoing, for you will be
associates of the Host of Heaven
1047 For you sinners say: “None of our sins will be inquired into and
written down!” But they will write down your sins every day
1048 And now I show you that light and darkness, day and night, see all
your sins
1049 Do not be impious in your hearts, and do not lie, and do not alter the
154



words of truth, nor say that the words of the Holy and Great One are lies,
and do not praise your idols For all your lies, and all your impiety, lead
not to righteousness but to great sin
10410 And now I know this mystery; that many sinners will alter and
distort the words of truth, and speak evil words, and lie, and concoct great
fabrications, and write books in their own words
10411 But when they write my words exactly in their languages, and do
not alter or omit anything from my words, but write everything exactly,
everything that I testified about before; then I know another mystery:
10412 That books will be given to the righteous and wise and will be a
source of joy and truth and much wisdom
10413 And books will be given to them, and they will believe in them and
rejoice over them; and all the righteous who have learnt from them all the
ways of truth will be glad
1051 And in those days, says the Lord, they shall call and testify to the
sons of the Earth about the wisdom in them Show it to them for you are
their leaders and the rewards will be over all the Earth
1052 For my son and I will join ourselves with them, forever, in the paths
of uprightness during their lives
And you will have peace
Rejoice - you sons of uprightness!

Amen

Notes Start: (21) ENOCH'S CONCLUDING WORDS (pages 157-158)
The conclusion to the book covers similar ground to the previous section but in a
shorter form Future glory is predicted for the righteous and darkness for the sinners
Notes End: (21) ENOCH'S CONCLUDING WORDS 
21) ENOCH'S CONCLUDING WORDS
1081 Another book which Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who should come after him and keep the law in the last days
1082 You who have observed, and are waiting in these days, until an end shall be made of those who do evil, and an end shall be made of the power of the wrongdoers
1083 Do indeed wait until sin shall pass away, for their names shall be erased from the Books of the Holy Ones, and their offspring will be destroyed forever And their spirits will be killed, and they will cry out and moan in a chaotic desert place, and will burn in fire, for there is no Earth there
1084 And there I saw something like a cloud, which could not be discerned, for because of its depth I was not able to look into it And the flames of a fire I saw, burning brightly, and things like bright mountains revolved and shook from side to side
1085 And I asked one of the Holy Angels, who were with me, and I said to him: “What is this bright place? For there is no sky, but only the flames of a burning fire, and the sounds of crying, and weeping, and moaning, and severe pain”
1086 And he said to me: “This place which you see; here will be thrown the spirits of the sinners, and of the blasphemers, and of those who do evil And of those who alter everything that the Lord has spoken through the mouths of the prophets about the things that shall be done
1087 For there are books, and records, about them in Heaven above so that the Angels may read them and know what is about to come upon the sinners And upon the spirits of the humble, and of those who afflicted their bodies and were recompensed by God, and of those who were abused by evil men
1088 Those who loved God and did not love gold, or silver, or any possessions, but gave up their bodies to torment
1089 Those who, from the moment they existed, did not desire earthly food, but counted themselves as a breath which passes away, and kept to this And the Lord tested them much, and their spirits were found pure, so that they might bless His Name”
10810 And all their blessings I have recounted in the books, and he has assigned them their reward, for they were found to be such that they loved Heaven more than their life in the world And although they were trampled underfoot by evil men, and had to listen to reviling and reproach from them, and were abused, yet they blessed their Lord
10811 And the Lord said: “And now I will call the spirits of the good, who are of the Generation of Light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with honour as was fitting to their faith
10812 And I will bring out into the shining light those who love my Holy Name and I will set each one on the throne of his honour”
10813 And they will shine for times without number, for righteous is the Judgment of God, for with the faithful He will keep faith in the dwelling of upright paths
10814 And they will see those who were born in darkness thrown into the darkness while the righteous shine
10815 And the sinners will cry out as they see them shining but they themselves will go where days and times have been written down for them
